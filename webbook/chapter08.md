# LATE CLASSICAL POETRY

According to an ancient and persistent tradition, the *Kalittokai*
and the *paripāṭal* belong to the original corpus of the *tokai* (anthology)
texts, and the *Tirumurukāṟṟuppaṭai* is quoted as the first of
the lays (*pāṭṭu*). However great our respect for the tradition may
be, we have to admit, after an unprejudiced and critical examination
of these three texts, that they almost certainly do not belong
to the earliest strata of the erotic and heroic poetry. The reasons for
a later dating of these poems are both formal, and of a different and
younger thought-content and ideology.

*Kalittokai,* lit. "the anthology in the *kali* metre" is a collection of
lovely songs which try to capture all phases, types and details of
love-experience; the anthology is an *akam* collection par *excellence*,
and, in fact, it seems to have been composed after the first arrangement,
systematization and classification of love-themes and lovesituations
had been worked out by some of the early scholiasts: the
peruntiṇai and kaikkiḷai situations (mismatched and one-sided
love-affairs) were added to complete the cycle of total love-experience
of man. It also seems that some folkmotifs and “vulgar” (<vul*gus*)
trends forced their way into the classical erotic poetry, with
rudimentary humorous and dramatic situations, with elements of
farce and buffoonery: the poems, composed in this new tone, deal
with affairs which are "common", "abnormal", "undignified",
fit only for "servants and workmen"; affairs which are fit for the
ignorant, the uncultured. These poems were not accepted as *akam*
proper by later theoreticians and compilers of the early anthologies,
but were classed under the kaikkiḷai and *peruntiṇai* situations, the
one-sided affair and the mismatched relationship.

The anthology has 150 poems in the kali metre. The first poem is
an invocation to Siva, and the rest are love-poems divided into the
five traditional divisions: 35 stanzas about *pālai*, 29 about *kuṟiňci,*
33 songs on *neytal.*[^peruntinai-kaikkilai] The compiler of the anthology was a certain
Nallantuvaṇār, supposed to be the author of the *neytal* portion,
and there exists a detailed and excellent commentary by Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar
(14th Cent.).

[^peruntinai-kaikkilai]: The *peruntiṇai* and kaikkiḷai situations are handled as additional to the
five *tiṇais*.

The background of the poem is the same as in early classical
poetry; but the tone is different. In a way, it is precisely the
*Kalittokai* anthology which marks a definite break from the early
classical tradition and conventions.

There are two fundamental problems to be dealt with in connection
with this anthology: first, the problem of the dating; second,
the question of authorship.

A very strong evidence points to the fact that the poems of
*Kalittokai* should be dated considerably later than the other
anthologies, roughly between the 5th-7th Cent. A.D.

First, the form, the metre, the structure of the poems, when
compared with the *akaval* and *vaňci* stanzas of early classical
poetry, display further development; the *kali* metre itself appears
to have been a later development; the *kali* stanza seems to be a
combination and a development of the *āciriyam* and the *veņpā.* It
can hardly be denied that the *kali*-metre and the *kali*-stanza is
later, historically younger than the *akaval* (and *vaňci*).

There are new structural elements in the *kali* stanzas: *dialogues*
which sometimes look like “a one-act play in miniature" (C. and
H. Jesudasan, op. cit. 67). Thus we have dialogues between the
heroine and her girl-friend (60), the heroine and the hero (64), the
girl-friend and the hero (61) etc. The narrative pieces which may be
considered as miniature tales are also new. Thus there is, apart
from the still predominantly lyrical character of the poetry, a new,
rudimentary but vigorous, dramatic and epic component in the
*Kalittokai*. New *dramatis* personae appear, too, folk-types like
*kāmakkiļatti* (67, 72, 73) “match-maker”*, kūni* (94) “the hunchback
woman" and *kuralan (ib*.) "the dwarf".

As already stressed, the tone is new and different: realistic attitude,
coarseness, spicy and racy dialogues, absence of delicacy,
broad jokes, crude humour, echoes of folk-songs. As a typical
instance one may quote the magnificent, rude, bawdy, and yet
strangely moving and poetic dialogue between the hunchback
woman and the dwarf (*Kalit*. 94, in the flawless translation of
A. K. Ramanujan):

>|       O hunchback woman,
>|       gentle
>|       and crooked as a reflection
>|       in the water,
>|       what great good deeds
>|       did you do that I should want you so?
>|       
>|       (O mother! she swore to herself) Some
>|       auspicious moment made you dwarf,
>|       so tiny you're almost invisible,
>|       O whelp born to a man-faced bird,
>|       how dare you stop us to say
>|       you want us? Would such midgets
>|       ever get to touch such as us?
>|       
>|       O lovely one,
>|           curvaceous,
>|               convex
>|       as the blade of a plough,
>|       you strike me with love
>|       I cannot bear.
>|           I can live
>|       only by your grace.
>|       (Look at the way this creature walks!)
>|       
>|       O dwarf, standing piece of timber,
>|       you've yet to learn the right approach
>|       to girls. Humans do not copulate
>|       at noon: but you come now to hold
>|       our hand and ask us to your place.
>|       
>|       Good woman,
>|           your waist is higher
>|       than your head, your face a skinned heron
>|       with a dagger for a beak,
>|           listen to me.
>|       If I take you in the front, your hunch
>|       juts in my chest; if from the back
>|       it'll tickle me in odd places.
>|           So, I'll not
>|       even try it. Yet come close and let's touch
>|       side by side.
>|       
>|       *Chī,* you're wicked. Get lost! You half-man!
>|       As creepers hang on only to the crook of the tree
>|       there are men who'd love to hold this hunch
>|       of a body close, though nothing fits. Yet, you lecher,
>|       you ask for us sideways. What's so wrong
>|       with us, you ball, you bush of a man,
>|       A gentle hunchback type is better far than a string
>|       of black beans.
>|       
>|       (Look at the walk of this creature!) You stand
>|       like a creepy turtle stood up by somebody,
>|       hands flailing in your armpits.
>|       We've told you we're not for you. Yet you hang around.
>|       (Look, he walks now like the Love-God)!
>|       
>|       The root of this love is Kāma,
>|       the love-god with arrows, brother to Shāma.
>|       Look, this is how the love-god walks!
>|           (Look,
>|       look at this love-god!)
>|       
>|       Come, let's find joy,
>|       you in me, me in you; come, let's ask and talk
>|       agree which parts I touch.
>|           I swear
>|       by the feet of my king, I'll mock you no more.
>|       
>|       Right, O gentle-breasted one. I too will give up
>|       mockery.
>|           But I don't want this crowd in the temple
>|       laughing at us, screaming when we do it,
>|       'Look, look! Look at that dwarf and hunchback,
>|       leaping like demon on demon!'
>|       
>|           O shape
>|       of unbeaten gold, let's get away from the temple
>|       to the wild jasmine bush. Come, let's go.
>|       You're now a gob of wax on a parchment
>|       made out in a court full of wise men,
>|           and stamped
>|       to a seal; you're now flat, incomplete. Come,
>|       let's touch close and hug hard
>|       and finish the unfinished.
>|           Let's go.

On the other hand, the traditional *aintiṇai* (i.e. "love proper")
situations continue in *Kalittokai* and even receive new possibilities
and new additions.

The language of *Kalittokai* manifests some features which are
undoubtedly to be considered as innovations, both lexical and
structural (e.g. the suffix *-kāl* in *allākkāl* 124, *-ēl* in *kāṭṭāyēl* 144, the
form *āṇāl* in 139, further cf. stanzas 84, 87, 90, 93, 130). A relatively
high number of Sanskrit loanwords (like *kāman, kāraṇam*, *kuṇanka!*
with the pl. suff. *-kaļ, picācar, mēkalai*, *vacciram*) attests, too, a
later origin.

Earlier poems are often quoted, e.g. *Kur*. 18.5 *uyirtavac* ciṟitu
*kāmamō* peritē "the endurance of my soul is small, but passion of
love is indeed great” reappears in *Kali*. 137.2: *peritē kāmamen nuyir-*
*tavac ciṟitē*.

Throughout the entire collection, no name of any king is mentioned
but of the *Panṭiya* in Maturai (55). No poets, chieftains,
battles etc. mentioned in the other *tokai* anthologies are alluded to
in the *Kalittokai.* On the other hand, *Kuṛiñcikkali* 24 mentions "the
merciful men of Benares", and in *Marutakkali* 29 there is an allusion
to Kāma (also elsewhere; these are the first allusions to this relatively
late Aryan import into Tamil literature). Actually, the whole
collection is permeated with allusions to Sanskritic Purāņic legends:
the burning of the three cities by Śiva (1), the plans of Duryodhana
to kill the Pāṇḍavas (25), the battle between Murukaṉ and Sūrapadma
(27), Rāvaṇa lifting Mount Kailāsa (38), Bhima beating
Duryodhana on the thigh (52), Kṛṣṇa killing Kamsa's wrestlers
(52, 134), Śiva thwarting Yama (101), Urvaśi and Tilottamā (109),
the story of Yayāti (139), Śiva bearing Gaṅgā in his locks (150),
Kṛṣṇa killing the horse-demon (103), Kṛṣṇa hiding the sun with his
*cakra* (104), etc.

All these facts point rather conclusively to the post-early classical
origin of *Kalittokai*.

In many ways, the collection seems to be work of one author; the
subject-matter, the style, the metre, the language. all indicates an
individual authorship of the whole collection (granted even the
over-all uniformity and homogeneity of the bardic poetry). On the
other hand, a rather late *veṇpā* quatrain[^ilakkiya-tipam] exists which ascribes the
five divisions of the anthology to five "Sangam" poets: *pālai* to
Perunkaṭunkōn, *kuṟiňci* to the great Kapilar, *marutam* to Marutan
Iļanākaṇār, *mullai* to Cōḻaṉ Nalluruttiran and *neytal* to Nallantuvaṇār
the Compiler. The *veṇpā* itself is not found in any manuscript of
the text, and is unknown to the commentator; its veracity may be
doubted. Allmost all serious scholars (the first editor of the work,
S. V. Damodaram Pillai, 1887, K. N. Sivaraja Pillai, Rajamanikkam,
H. W. Schomerus) are inclined to regard *Kalittokai* as the
work of one poet, who probably belonged to the *Pāṇṭiyaland.*

[^ilakkiya-tipam]: Cf. Vaiyapuri Piḷḷai, *Ilakkiya* tipam (1952) 81.

The problem is far from definitely solved. But the work itself is
great and deserves careful study, monographic treatment, and a
congenial translation *in toto*.

*Paripāṭal* is traditionally enumerated as the fifth of the collections
 *(tokai*); it is an odd, hybrid work, partly traditional love-poetry
and partly a work of *bhakti*. It is a collection of poems in the
*paripaṭal* metre,[^paripatal] which seems to be further development of the
old classical metres. Of the seventy poems supposed to have been
originally included in this work, only twenty four are extant in
full (a few more are in fragments, and some (22, 24) may be found in
a commentary on the *Tōlkappiyam,* and in the medieval anthology
*Purattiraṭṭu)*. Of the extant poems, seven are dedicated to Tirumāl,
eight to Cevvēļ (Murukan), and nine to the river Vaikai. In the
Vaikai-portion, the love-theme is worked out along the traditional
lines against the background of bathing festivities. The stanzas are
ascribed to 13 poets, one of whom figures among the poets of other
anthologies.

The most noticeable feature of this collection are the colophons
to each stanza which, beside the name of the author, give also the
names of the composer who set it to music and of the tune to which
it was set. The basic tunes (*paņ*, *icai*) are *pālai*, *yāl, tiram* and
*kāntāram*; the names of the composers are Kaṇṇakaṇār, Kaṇṇanākaṇār,
Kēcavaṇār Nallaccutaṇār, Naṇṇākaṇār, Nākaṇār, Pittāmattar,
Pēṭṭaṇākaṇār, Maruttuvan Nallaccutaṇār. There is a
detailed commentary available composed by Parimēlaḻakar. The
work was published first in 1918 by U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar.

It seems that the poems were indeed composed as songs, intended
to be sung. The work is relatively late. It seems to be separated at
least by three centuries from the earlier collections. First of all,
there are many Aryan loanwords, and their number and nature
betray a late origin of the text, e.g. *kavitai* (6), *mitunam* (11),
*cintikka* (20), pōkam (5), *kamalam* (2) etc. There are also some
characteristic grammatical innovations like the present-tense
suffix -kiny-, and forms which are undoubtedly rather late in the
history of the language, e.g. *nāṇ* (20.82) “I”, or *āmām* “emphatic
affirmation".

[^paripatal]: *paripāṭal* is mentioned as a metre in *Tolk. Ceyyul*. 242. The number of
lines is unlimited; it is on the whole a rather loose structure with verses
ranging from one foot to four feet, exceptionally to five feet, and it provides
for much variety. For the hybrid nature of the work, cf. e.g. the definition of
its content in *Yapparunkala virutti*: *teyvamum kāmamum poruļāka varum*
"as the subject-matter, both devotion and love occur". Out of the 70 original
stanzas, 8 should have been dedicated to *Tirumal*, 31 to *Murukaṉ*, I to
*Kāṭukilā!* (*Korravai*?), 26 to the river Vaikai, 4 to *Maturai.* All commentators,
beginning with Iḷampūraṇar, interpret the term *paripăṭal* as *parinta*
*pāṭṭu* "running, speeding, rapid song".

Second, there are references in the text to temples and shrines
which must have been built in the post-classical period (Tiruvēnkaṭam,
Tiruvaṇantapuram etc.), and mural paintings on the walls of
Tirupparankunṛam temple are mentioned depicting stars and planets.
Many allusions to a number of *Puranic* stories betray, too, the
relatively late origin of the poem: thus we hear of the churning of
the ocean of milk (2.71-72, 3-33-4), of Prahlāda (4.12-21), of the birth
of Murukaṉ (5.27-49), of the destruction of the three cities (5.25) etc.

There is no great devotional fervour in the poems, and the lyrical
quality of the text is not exactly outstanding. One can regard these
poems as a form of transition-not very successful-between the
classical, traditional love poetry, and the emerging, devotional,
*bhakti* literature.

More interesting, and better poetry, is the first intensely devotional
poem in Tamil literature, the *Tirumurukāṟṟuppaṭai*. As the
name suggests, it is a "guide" poem, not to any liberal patron of
arts, however, but to different manifestations of god Murukaṉ.
The devotee, the *bhakta,* is directed by the poet to various shrines
of the god. The "Guide to Lord Muruku" seems to have been
considered by the redactor of the *Pattuppāṭṭu* collection as the
invocatory lay to the "Ten Songs" (in analogy with the invocatory
stanzas prefixed to the Anthology collections).[^Kailasapathy] The poem is held
in very high esteem not only by Murukaṉ worshippers for whom it
is the most ancient and fundamental text, but by all Saivites. It is
an excellent poem in 312 *akaval* verses, and it is ascribed to Nakkīrar
(whom the tradition makes identical with the author of the early
lyrical pieces, but who is very probably much younger than the
"Sangam" Nakkīrar; he may be identical with the author of the
commentary to *Iṟaiyaṉār Akapporuḷ).*

[^Kailasapathy]: K. Kailasapathy, op. cit. 35.s

The poem is carefully planned out, according to a definite scheme
which is based upon a very fundamental conception in South Indian
Hinduism: the intimate connection between a particular place of
worship and the god's "local" manifestation. The poem has six
parts of unequal length: the first describes the beauty of Murukaṉ,
the killing of Surapadma, the excellence of Maturai and Tirupparankunram;
in the second, the six faces of Murukaṉ are described and
their functions, as well as his twelve arms and their work, and the
temple in Tiruccir; the third part deals with the shrine in Tiruvāviṉaṉkuṭi,
the fourth with the temple in Tiruvēṟakam, in the fifth the
poet narrates the sports of the god in the hills, the sixth describes
the shrine in Palamutirccolai.

The effects of contrast are exploited cleverly by the poet: Murukaṉ,
surrounded by lovely goddesses, is very different from the
Murukaṉ in the battlefield. There the "she-devil (*pēymaka!)* dances
the *tuṇankai* dance ...

>|       dry-haired,
>|       twisted and projecting teeth
>|       in her gaping mouth,
>|       rolling eye-balls,
>|       greenish eyes
>|       with a fearful gaze,
>|       ears that pain her heavy breasts
>|       as the owl with bulging eyes
>|       and the cruel snake
>|       hang down from her ears
>|       bothering her breasts.
>|       In her hands with shining bangles
>|       she holds a black skull,
>|       smelling rotten.
>|       With her cruel, sharp-nailed fingers
>|       stirring blood
>|       she had dug-out human eyeballs
>|       and eaten them up.
>|       As she dances, shoulders heaving,
>|       her mouth drips with fat. [^thuNangai]

[^thuNangai]: This is probably the occasion to say a few words about "the fantastic,
gruesome, and grotesque" (C. and H. Jesudasan, op. cit. 187) aspects in
Tamil literature. In heroic poems of the early classical age, the gory aspect
plays quite a prominent role; as in heroic poetry elsewhere, and in the
feudal poetry of the Occident, the gory and gruesome face of killing is
described with gusto and in detail: it is a part of the prowess and glory of the
heroes the "assertion of superior force" (K. Kailasapathy, op. cit. 239).
There are many instances of gruesome scenes in Tamil bardic poetry, with
"trunks dancing", "vultures feeding upon carrion", "elephants pierced with
arrows", "spears soaked in blood" etc. As an instance, a few lines from
*Patiṟṟuppattu* 49.10-44 may be quoted (Kailasapathy, op. cit. 240): "The
blood gushing out of the chests of the warriors of red hands who opposed
you, flows and spreads on the ground like the reddish muddy water that
flows on to the low lying lands on a rainy day. Terrible is the destruction
you bring on the battle field, where you pile up fallen corpses". *Tolk*. has a
poetic theme called *aṭṭaiyāṭal* (cf. Ka. *aṭṭe* "a headless trunk", Te. *aṭṭa* “id.",
*DED* 90): "hero's body continuing to manifest heroic deeds even after
dismemberment, as the quivering of a leech (*aṭṭai,* DED 89) after being cut
into two". \
\ \ \ \ Slaughter of men and an/imals alike is described with great gusto. From
the
*gloire* of a slayer of elephants, an entire genre developed in the middle
ages: the *paraņi,* a war poem about a hero who has destroyed 700 elephants.
The greatest of the *paraņis* is *Kaliṅkattupparaṇi* by Cayankoṇṭār, the courtpoet
of Kulōttuńka Cōḻa (1070-1122). In many ways, it is a great and marvellous
poem, probably the most colourful poem in the entire Tamil literature, in
which erotic experience and blood-thirstiness is painted in the same glowing
colours. But the fantastic and the gruesome have perhaps "not been treated
with more vividness elsewhere in Tamil literature" ( C. and H. Jesudasan,
op. cit. 187). The poem is inhabited by blood-lusting devils, lean and famished
for want of human flesh. After the battle, the devils, with mouths watering,
rush in a wild stampede to the battle-field. The Brahmin devil gapes for the
tasty soup of stinking corpses, but the Jain devil (which does not take life
and eats only once a day) is to be given the strained soup indeed an admirable
sense of humour on the part of the poet! And the Buddhist devil,
going about wrapped in skins, is given the delicious brains of the dead (this,
too, is humour). \
\ \ \ \ An extremely relevant passage of the great medieval commentator
Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar on *TP* gives much insight on the theme of sacrifice to the
devils (*pey,* DED 3635 "demon, goblin, fiend, devil", To. *on* “god of the
dead", in Gondi, Kui and Kuvi "god", which is very suggestive). A gruesome
ritual was performed in honour of Korravai, the goddess of war and victory,
and probably the old Dravidian mother-goddess (*DED* 1803 *korram* “victory,
power, bravery"). It consisted of the following features: 1) it was performed
at the end of a battle by the victors; 2) wholesale sacrifice of men, animals
and weapons took place; 3) some sort of ritual cooking was done, using
blood; 4) priestesses officiated at the ceremony. \
\ \ \ \ It seems though this needs further and careful investigation--that there
are references to the ritual of human sacrifice (and probably an echo of
cannibalism) in *Puṟam* 62, 356, 359, 369-71, *Patiṟṟup*. 13, 15, etc.


The whole poem seems to be aglow with red, the colour of Murukaṉ;
images of blood are frequent (e.g. "pure white rice mixed with
the blood of a fat strong ram with stout legs" is brought as an
offering to the god); Murukaṉ's body glows like the sun rising from
the emerald sea---the peacock which the "red god" rides; celestial
damsels, blessing the cock-banner of the youthful god, have

>|       “... bright, rosy, tender feet ...
>|       thin garments purple like the Indragopa”;

and the hills grow the *kāntaḷ* flowers red like fire; and across his
handsome wide chest run red lines *(cempori*).

Flames, blood, red garments, red lustre-we encounter these
images again and again, and probably the most frequent epithet is
"shining, lustrous" and "fire-like” *(vāļ* in 8, 87, 90, ol in 28, 31, 54,
tikal in 40, *cuṭar* in 43, 46, *min* in 85, *nakai* in 86, viļaku in 87,
etc. etc.).

There are also a few magnificent natural scenes; and the technique of contrast is cleverly employed. Listen to the first 20 lines
in a very inadequate translation:

>|       Like the sun seen in the sea,
>|       the delight of the world.
>|       praised by men,
>|       he is the dazzling light
>|       visible from afar
>|       even through eyes
>|       which are closed.
>|       
>|       His feet are strong.
>|       They destroy ignorance
>|       and support
>|       his friends.
>|       His mighty arm
>|       rivals
>|       the thunderbolt.
>|       It has crushed
>|       his fiends.
>|       
>|       He is the bridegroom
>|       of the maid
>|       whose front is fair
>|       and who is
>|       gently chaste.
>|       
>|       The forests,
>|       cool and fragrant
>|       after first showers,
>|       pouring down
>|       from gigantic clouds,
>|       pregnant with waters
>|       sucked up from the sea,
>|       scattering heavy drops
>|       upon the firmament
>|       whose darkness is dispelled
>|       by the sun and the moon.
>|       
>|       The forests,

>|       by the dense leaves
>|       of the red *katampu* tree.

>|       of its flowers
>|       rolling on his chest.

Murukaṉ has two wives; the senior, Teyvayāṇai, is the daughter
of Indra; the younger is "the beautiful daughter of the hunters,
little Vaḷḷi, with creeper-like slender waist" (101-102).[^karpu] The god's
priest is called *vēlan* (190) "he who wears the spear"; and the men
in the jungle drink in the god's honour liquor prepared from honey
matured in bamboo (*nīṭamai viļainta tēkkaṭ ṭēral,* 195). But, in his
temples, there are also the *dvijas*, the twice-born (*iruppirappāļar,*
182), wearing the sacred thread of three bands. Elsewhere, the Vedas
are mentioned (*mantiram*, 95), and the sages (*munivar*, 137); and
the whole poem shows in fact the fusion of the Brahmanic god
Skanda with the pre-Aryan, South Indian Murukaṉ. The poem
contains much old, traditional material (like the relationship of
Murukaṉ to Korravai, the old mother-goddess of the Tamils). It is
typically a poem of transition, marking the end of an epoch, the
end of pre-Aryan Tamilnad, the end of the classical age; and the
beginning of an entirely different age which is heralded by the rise
of devotional literature. It is perhaps significant that the first truly
religious, devotional poem in Tamil is dedicated to Murukaṉ, the
Tamil deity *par excellence*.

[^karpu]: According to later speculations, *kaṟpu* "chastity" is of two types: the
stern (*maram*) and the gentle (*aram*). Draupadi and Kaṇṇaki represent the
former type, while Sītā and Teyvayāṇai represent “gentle chastity".

Apart from what was said about its subject matter, there are also
other indications that the poem may hardly be older than about
550-600 A.D.; there are some very serious authors who place it
around A.D. 800.[^murukan-poem-age] There are some rather late forms and innovations
in the language (*perīiyar* 168, *nalkumati* 295 etc.); many of the
Aryan loanwords (which are abundant) are rather late borrowings
*(tilakam*, *nakaram, caṇpakam, ankucam* etc.); earlier texts are cited
(e.g. *Nar.* 62: *Tirumuruk*. 24). There is also the fact that, according
to U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar, most of the *Pattuppāṭṭu* manuscripts
used by him for his edition do not contain the text of this poem.

[^murukan-poem-age]: S. Vaiyapuri Pillai*, HTLL* p. 58. On p. 113, he dates it "about A.D. 700".

The poem is very important for the development of South Indian
*bhakti* in that it contains, in lines 60-66, the summary of its fundamental
principles: salvation as the goal of existence; salvation
means to take one's station at the feet of the Lord; to love the Lord;
to attain this means to give up egoism, sense of separation (63, 64);
the poem says literally: "to reach the feet of Cēy with elevated
heart" *(cēeycēvaṭi pataruň cemma lullamotu* (61-62). This is pure
bhakti.

No wonder that the poem found its way into the 11th *Tirumuṟai,*
the corpus of Saivite Canonical writings.
