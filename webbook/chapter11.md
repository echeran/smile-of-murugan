# The Lay Of The Anklet

According to Jules Bloch, *Cilappatikāram* or the "Lay of the
Anklet" is one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult of all
Tamil ancient poetical works.[^most-difficult-tamil-work] In spite of this, the poem was
translated into English,[^english-translation] French,[^french-translation] Russian[^russian-translation] and Czech.[^czech-translation] It is
only the Czech version which renders prose by prose and verse by
verse in exact agreement with the original text. All the other
translations are more or less exact[^exact-translations] prosaic renderings of the
poem and, though this is very sad, they lack almost totally the
great poetic splendour and grace of the original.

What is the *Cilappatikāram*? According to Aṭiyārkkunallār, the
medieval commentator on the work, it is an *iyalicaināṭakapporuļ-*
*toṭarnilaicceyyul*[^description-compound-word]; this somewhat lengthy compound means a
poetic work dealing with a story which has the elements of songs and
dance (*or*, music and drama)". This is not a bad definition of the
main formal properties of the work, but it is hardly a satisfactory
answer to the question about the essential character of the epos.
According to my opinion, *Cilappatikāram* is

[^description-compound-word]: Cf. *ivviyalicaināṭakap poruṭṭotarnilaic ceyyulai atikal* ceykinra *kālattu*. . .
(p. 6 of the 1950 U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar's ed.).

\ 1) a saga of the cult of Goddess Pattiṉi, 2) the first literary
expression and the first ripe fruit of the Aryan-Dravidian synthesis
in Tamilnad, 3) the first consciously national work of Tamil literature,
the literary evidence of the fact that the Tamils had by that
time attained nationhood.

The legend obviously existed in the indigenous tradition long
before the great poem was born, and independent of it. An old poem,
*Naṟṟiṇai* 216, and a probably even older poem, *Puṟam* 278,[^motive]
mention the motive; it occurs later in the *Vaiṣyapuraṇa,* in the
commentary to *Yapparuňkalavirutti* we find a line which is part of
the heroine's lament, but is not found in our versions of the great
epic. According to Amitacākarar's *Yapparunkalam* I.351, there is a
poem referred to as having been composed by Pattiṉi or Kaņṇaki.[^poem-by-kannaki]
The story of the "great chaste lady" is known even today in balladform
as *Kōvalankatai*, in “*puraṇic*" form as *Kaṇṇaki Purāṇam*.
The heroes, however, became duly transformed: Kōvalaṉ is a
licensed profligate, Mātavi an avaricious prostitute, and Kaṇṇaki
a terrible shrew. I heard myself illiterate workers in the textile
mills of Maturai speak of "Kōvalom” and “Karņi”; in their version,
too, the classical Mātavi was transformed into Mākati, the corrupt
daughter of a *devadāsi* by name of Vasantamālā.[^folk-version-daughter-servant-characters]

*Puṟam* 278: en / *mulaiyaru* ttiṭuven *yān* (v.1. *mulaiyaruttiṭukuvan).*

[^poem-by-kannaki]: T. P. Meenakshisundaran, *HTL,* p. 43.

[^folk-version-daughter-servant-characters]: In the original poem, Vacantāmalai is a servant-girl and companion of
Mātavi.

The cult of Pattiṉi is alive in a few places in Kerala[^kerala-worship-kannaki] and Ceylon,
as a minor cult connected with fertility rites and marriages. However,
twelve or fifteen hundred years ago, the cult of Pattiṉi, the goddess
of chastity, must have been rather important and widely-spread
throughout today's Tamilnad, Kerala and Ceylon.[^ceylon-kannaki-statues]

[^kerala-worship-kannaki]: In Cranganore on the West Coast, Durgā-Bhagavati is still worshipped
as *Orraimulaicci* "The woman with one breast". Cf. also N. Vanamamalai,
"The Folk motif in Silappadikaram", Proc. I *International Tamil Conference*
*Seminar* II (1966) 138-63.

[^ceylon-kannaki-statues]: There exists a number of beautiful bronzes of Pattiṉi of Ceylonese
*provenience* (probably the best known among them being the great statue of
the standing goddess in the British Museum, 10th Cent., and a small but
charming sitting Pattiṉi from Trincomalee, 10th Cent.). Cf. also H. Neville
(1887) (transl.) "The Story of Kovalan. Ceylon Tamil Version", Tamil
*Culture* X2 (1963) 72-84.

The story must have been well and widely known, and this is the
reason why the poet of *Cilappatikāram* “could afford to be irritatingly
allusive and terse in important narrative passages and lingers
lovingly over interesting descriptions" (Basham).

But Iḷaṅkōvaṭikaḷ's great poem, although a version of the widelyspread
and obviously very old legend, is primarily a story of human
proportions, of human love and passion, jealousies, infidelity,
charity and forgiveness, so human in fact, that the *deus ex machina*
appears more or less casually and as a non-essential factor, or is
rather forced to appear by the logic of human passions and actions.
It is Kaṇṇaki, the woman, the human heroine, who alone matters
to the poet; it is Kaṇṇaki, who-backed by the sympathy of the
entire people of Maturai-performs her duty and avenges the death
of her husband, it is she who at one moment doubts the very
existence of God, and who finally conquers and overthrows the law
of *karma,* she who enforces gods and fate to capitulate.
And the fact that, in the third book of the poem, this extremely
human and humane heroine, this woman who is transformed before
our eyes from simple, quiet, patient maid into a passionate, admirable
woman of the magnitude of a Greek heroine, becomes a goddess,
is the logical and very Indian outcome of her inner growth and
development.

Canto 30, lines 155-164, contain the “Gajabāhu synchronism",
discussed above.[^gajabahu-synchronism] We came to the conclusion that the hero of the
3rd book, *Cēral* king Cenkuṭṭuvan, was a contemporary of Gajabāhu
I (171-193 A.D.), king of Ceylon.

[^gajabahu-synchronism]: Cf. Chapter 3, pp. 37-8.

The Gajabāhu Synchronism became at once an object of sharp
criticism. The objections were well-founded: first, if Cenkuṭṭuvan
the *Cēral* and Gajabāhu of Ceylon indeed met at the end of the 2nd
Cent. A.D., and if, as the text and a persistent tradition maintain,
Cenkuṭṭuvan's younger brother, prince Iḷaṅkō, was the author of
the poem, how to explain the striking differences between the language
of the epic poem and that of the classical Tamil lyrics, which
should be contemporaneous with the *Cilappatikāram*?[^gajabahu-synchronism-criticism]

[^gajabahu-synchronism-criticism]: The epical poem contains such pronominal forms as *nāṇ* and *tām*; it
contains twice the present-tense suffix; a later conditional form *unṭēl;*
forms like *inta,* and a number of lexical innovations, e.g. tampi, *kaṭai* etc.

How to account for the fact that the ideologies, beliefs, customs,
manners, rites and cults, the entire social, religious and philosophical
background of *Cilappatikāram* is strikingly different from
the social, political and cultural world of the so-called *Caṅkam*
poetry? The civilization portrayed in the epos reflects beyond any
doubt a well-progressed synthesis of the pre-Aryan and the Aryan
elements in all spheres of life and culture, thinking and social habits.
*Cilappatikāram* quotes some didactic poems (e.g. Tirukkuṟaḷ 55 or
*Palamolināṇūru* 46). By no stretch of imagination is it possible to
consider the bulk of the classical Tamil bardic poetry and the epos
―as we have it today—as contemporary literature.

But the defenders of the faith in the Gajabāhu Synchronism
supported their hypothesis by no less valid arguments; and they
proved that Cenkuṭṭuvan's age must be assigned roughly to 100-250
A.D., not later. In other words Cenkuṭṭuvan and Gajabāhu were
contemporaries. Aṭiyārkkunallār, the medieval commentator on
*Cilappatikāram,* calculated the date of the departure of Kōvalaṉ and
Kaṇṇaki from Kāvirippaṭṭinam (computing on the basis of astronommical
data) as 174 A.D.

The Gajabāhu Synchronism was accepted by most of the serious
scholars, since, to quote K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, “it fits very well
with all other lines of evidence derived from the general probabilities
of history in North and South India... from archeology, from
Greek and Roman authors, and from early Tamil literary sources”.[^gajabahu-nilakanta-fits-other-history]
On the other hand, *Cilappatikāram*, as we have it today, cannot
have been composed before the 5th-6th Cent. A.D.

[^gajabahu-nilakanta-fits-other-history]: A *Comprehensive History* of *India* Vol. 2 (1957).

Somehow or other, the most simple solution, as it frequently
happens, did not occur to scholars for a long time. And so the antagonists
of the Gajabāhu Synchronism, and those who rightly
maintained that the work must be of later date, joined forces and
proclaimed that the 3rd book of *Cilappatikāram*, which contains
the Gajabāhu Synchronism and the tradition of Iḷaṅkō's authorship,
is not an integral part of the work; that it is, *in toto,* a later appendix.
This was naturally a very serious statement to make. But the antagonists
of the poem's integrity had some very impressive arguments.
First of all, the structural argument: the first two books, they
maintained, were self-sufficient, they formed a semantically and
functionally closed structure, a single complete story. The story of
the two lovers is finished and needs no continuation whatsoever.
The third book is a non-functional appendix, an independent
panegyric in the old bardic tradition, which has nothing to do with
the story of Kōvalaṉ and Kanṇaki.[^third-book-as-appendix]

[^third-book-as-appendix]: This argument, which sounds so strikingly non-Indian, originated
interestingly enough with a Tamil scholar, P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar (1929),
and was later elaborated by another-Marxist-oriented-Tamil scholar,
Cami Citamparaṉār, in books written in Tamil.

It is true that, from the point of the story itself, the first two
books form a perfectly closed cycle (at least if we apply the Western
aestetic criteria); but, from the point of the subject-matter and
thought-content of the poem, and in full agreement with the Indian
tradition and the Indian aestetic theories, it is only just that the
heroine should ultimately become an object of deification, and
that the epos should contain a panegyric on the ruling dynasty
whose member very probably the poet had himself been.

But, even from the point of its form, of its structure, the epos
must be viewed as patterned into its three books. First of all, in the
traditions of classical Tamil poetry, *Cilappatikāram* celebrates both
love and war, dealing with both *akam* and *puṟam,* and without the
third book it would be incomplete. The first book, dedicated to the
land of the Cholas, is like a stage set for the opening and development
of the tragical story of human passions. The second book,
describing the Pandya country, contains the climax of the human
story, the culmination of the tragedy. And the third book, portraying
the land of the Cheras-since times immemorial an integral part of
the Tamil land-contains the typically Indian conclusion of the
story: the deification of Kaņṇaki-Pattini. Thus, the poem has
three dominant phases, it is like a three-fold classical music composition,
each of the phases set in one of the capitals of the three Tamil
kingdoms. The "Lay of the Anklet" is the first consciously national
work of Tamil literature. It transcends the barriers of different
"landscapes" since it deals with all of them; it ignores tribal and
clannish divisions and loyalties; Iḷaṅkōvaṭikaḷ has purposely set
the stage for the tale in all three Tamil kingdoms, enshrining in his
poem the whole of Tamil India.

There are two other valid reasons why the third book has to be
regarded as an organic, indispensable and integral part of the poem:
the unanimous consensus of the indigenous tradition, and the fact
that the language of the entire work, its diction and style, are
perfectly homogeneous.

Those who distrust the colophons to *Patiṟṟuppattu*, as well as
those who tried to prove that the 3rd book of *Cilappatikāram* was
almost a late forgery, have committed one very basic fallacy: they
thought that late material was necessarily unauthentic; their
utterly false contention was that the content of a work could not
be older than its form. But, as K. A. Nilakanta Sastri says, the colophons
to *Patiṟṟuppattu* as well as the *Cilappatikāram* “embody
genuine history" and are exceptionally accurate and trustworthy,
as is usually the case with traditional oral material. The synchronism
of Cenkuṭṭuvan and Gajabāhu-a reliable date in itself—is not
valid for the time of the origin of the poem as we have it today; it is
not valid as the date of the literary work; but it is valid for the time
when the historical Gajabāhu met with the historical Cenkuṭṭuvan,
that is, it is valid for the story which forms the content of the 3rd
book of the poem.

*Cilappatikāram* is primarily the story of Kaṇṇaki. Wedded when
she was "not yet twelve", beautiful "as the goddess of Fortune"
but "more shy than Arundhati”, a sheltered and beloved maid,
tender and silent.

The young couple, Kōvalaṉ and Kaṇṇaki, keep, for some time,
a quiet and happy home, spending "sweet, pleasure-filled days in
close embrace". Kōvalaṉ loves Kaṇṇaki tenderly and passionately.

>|       "Flawless gold,
>|       translucent pearl,
>|       unblemished seed,
>|       sweet sugar cane,
>|       honey,
>|       rare maid!" [^kokilam]

That is how he calls her. But the fore-taste of the tragedy is there,
at the very beginning of the poem.

>|       "Kovalan and Kaṇṇaki lay entwined
>|       like two black serpents on their couch,
>|       drank to its depth their cup of love,
>|       already having felt, perhaps,
>|       how transient is human joy." [^danielou1]

Then Kōvalaṉ abandons Kaṇṇaki for Mātavi, the dancing girl,
who lives in grand style, lures her lover to the fashionable resorts of
the time, and who is set marvellously into contrast with the patient,
chaste wife. On account of a silly quarrel, Kōvalaṉ and Mātavi part.
So it seems at least-but the fact is that Kövalan has lost faith in
Mätavi, and he was probably overspent and exhausted by the kind
of life he was leading as her lover. "Long-eyed Madhavi had patiently
listened to all these sailor songs. But she felt they showed a
change in Kovalan's feelings. Angry but pretending to be pleased,
she took the harp..." [^danielou2]

[^kokilam]: Transl. S. Kokilam.

[^danielou1]: Transl. A. Daniélou (1965).

[^danielou2]: Transl. A. Daniélou (1965).


Kōvalaṉ is back at home, which is sad and quiet, with Kaṇṇaki,
chaste and faithful, waiting. She is prepared to follow him wherever
he will go. Mātavi's plea for reconciliation is rejected. Ruined in his
career, Kōvalaṉ accepts his wife's anklets-*cilampu*-to raise the
money on which to build a new life. For this purpose they travel
to Maturai, the Pandya's capital. On their long and strenuous
journey, Kavunti Aṭikaḷ, a Jaina nun, gives them much comfort
and friendship. In Maturai, Kōvalaṉ entrusts first his beloved to
the care of poor and honest folk of the shepherd community, and
then walks forth alone to seek out a jeweller who would help him
sell Kannaki's anklet.

Thus he meets his fate: a goldsmith, who “had the face of Death's
dread messenger", who has stolen the queen's anklet, sees a golden
opportunity in Kōvalaṉ's coming. He accuses Kōvalaṉ before the
king, and the king says: "Put the man to death and bring me the
bracelet!" Since Kaṇṇaki's anklet resembles the jewel of the queen,
Kōvalaṉ's doom is sealed. He is murdered by a drunken soldier of
the king. "Blood gushing from the wound felt upon the Earth,
mother of men, and she shuddered with grief".

When Kaṇṇaki arrives on the scene-now an entirely different
being, no more the meek and silent girl we met in the first book
―she proves her husband's innocence by bursting open the other
anklet—incidentally, a deeply symbolic act—revealing to the king
the ruby inside instead of the pearls which were contained in the
queen's jewel. The shocked king is killed by remorse, and his queen
dies a true sati. Kaṇṇaki's wrath turns now on the capital city of
Maturai, the seat of crime and profligacy; twisting off “her lovely
breast" and hurling it on to the city, she sets fire to Maturai and the
whole town goes up in flames. Only "Brahmins, good men, cows,
truthful women, cripples, old men and children” are spared.
Kaṇṇaki then turns west to the land of the Cheras where Kōvalaṉ,
in a divine chariot, meets her on a mountain and they are received
into heaven.

A temple to Kaṇṇaki is built in Vaňci, the Chera capital. Cenkuṭṭuvan,
the powerful *Cēral* king, has the stone for carving her
image brought down all the way from the Himalayas on the
shoulders and heads of conquered arya kings. Kaṇṇaki comes back
to grace the temple with her presence, now a full-blown deity.

The poet, Iḷaṅkōvaṭikaḷ, who composed his masterpiece sometime
between the 4th-6th Cent. A.D. (this is how a historical linguist
would date the text) was, according to tradition, the younger
brother of Cenkuṭṭuvan, and the son of King Cēralātaṉ Imaiyavarampan.
He renounced the throne which, according to the prophecy
of a soothsayer, he should have had occupied. The vow of asceticism
kept faithfully all his life earned for Iḷaṅkō which means simply
"prince" or "younger brother of the king" the title Aṭikaḷ or "saint".

It is not improbable that the author of the epos actually belonged
to the *Cēral* royal family-though of course to a period much later
than his famous forebear Cenkuṭṭuvan. And it is not ruled out-as
maintained in the introduction to the poem-that it was another
poet, Cattaṇār (the author of the "twin-epic" *Maṇimēkalai*), a
friend of Iļaṁkō, who discussed one version of the Kaņṇaki-Pattiņi
legend with Iḷaṅkō; and this discussion inspired Iḷaṅkō to compose
the poem. Or the poem, as we have it now, was composed by some
unknown poet and ascribed to an Iḷaṅkō, a prince of the *Cēral* clan.
Though an argument *ex silentio*, we should not forget the fact that
ancient Tamil poetry which knows well king Cenkuṭṭuvan (witness
the panegyric bardic collection *Patiṟṟuppattu*) does not at all, not
once, mention any brother of his, a prince by name of Iḷaṅkō.
Anyhow, the cult of Kanṇaki-Pattini must have been wide-spread
and well-established in Cheranad; but, at the same time, Jainism
and Buddhism were still flourishing in the South, which also shows
that Iḷaṅkō composed his poem sometime between the end of the
4th and the end of the 6th Cent. A.D. He embodied a reliable
historical tradition in his poem: his royal ancestor Cenkuṭṭuvan,
victorious in battles with the aryas, is conceived as a national
Tamil hero, and Iḷaṅkō describes his march to the North and
finally the erection of a shrine to Pattiṉi, which was witnessed by a
number of contemporary rulers, among them Gajabāhu I of Ceylon.

The only false statement Iḷaṅkō has made is that, at the very end
of the poem, he brought himself into the story, as if he had personally
witnessed the meeting of the kings in honour of Pattiṉi. This kind
of fraud is well-known from other literatures, and not only from
India, and may be easily forgiven.

The driving forces of the story spring out of the hearts of the
heroes, mainly of course of Kaṇṇaki, Kōvalaṉ and Mātavi. One of
the greatest merits of the work is the treatment of the problem of
evil; the poet's conception of guilt.[^poem-treatment-evil-guilt] Who is to be blamed for the
tragedy? The hot-headed king? The week Köōvalan? The attractive
Mātavi? Or Fate itself?

[^poem-treatment-evil-guilt]: I remember having read years ago (1958) a discussion of this problem
in a Tamil journal the name of which I unfortunately forgot. Its author was
T. A. Chokkalingam.

*Cilappatikāram* is not a story of schematic shadowy figures, of
faultless heroes and demoniac villains. If we ask who actually is the
villain of the piece, we are unable to answer. Nobody is entirely to
be blamed and all of them are guilty. Not a single character in
*Cilappatikāram* is thoroughly bad or thoroughly good—not even
the pious Jaina woman-ascetic, and probably not even Kaṇṇaki.

Certainly not the king, "the virtuous Pandya monarch, the
noble Nedunjeliyan", who is not intrinsically unjust or evil-he is
only hot-tempered and unbalanced. Wherein lies his guilt? Instead
of calling for an inquiry, instead of saying "Bring him along with
the anklet for being executed if found guilty", the king says: "Put
the man to death and bring me the bracelet!"

Is Mātavi the immoral and vicious harlot as she appears in some
folk versions of the same matter? Not at all. She is a charming
character: sweet, clever, cultured, loving, passionate, trained to
attract. Was it her fault that she was born in her caste and trained
to become a courtezan?

Is Kōvalaṉ a bad character? He certainly is not. He is of that
tribe of Indian literary heroes who are "courteous, kindly, generous,
competent, gentle-spoken, popular, pure, eloquent, well-descended,
stable, young, intelligent, energetic, with a fine memory, insightful,
artistic, self-respecting, courageous, consistent, vigorous, learned
in the sciences, and observant of the Dharma" (Dhanamjaya's
*Daśarupa,* quoted by J. A. B. van Buitenen, 1968). However, this
hero "is more often than not involved in amorous intrigue" (van
Buitenen), and he is no proof against the vices of society and the
charms of an attractive courtezan.

The only figure that is clearly good from the beginning to the end,
painted with one bright colour, is Kaṇṇaki. But she, too, is very
human; she, too, is not fully perfect. In perfection there is, metaphysically,
so to say, no change; once perfect, always perfect. Many
of the heroines of classical Sanskrit erotic poetry and drama are
predictable; they are stereotypes; they are of importance only in
relation to the hero. Kaṇṇaki is very different. There is tremendous
change in her. At the beginning of the story, she is an innocent,
obedient and silent girl, almost a mere child. When Kōvalaṉ
returns to her, we would expect a passionate scene of reconciliation.
There is no such thing. There are no recriminations, no explanations.
"I feel great shame”, says Kōvalaṉ, “at the dire poverty that I
bring into this house today". Kaṇṇaki welcomes him "with a clear
smile" and answers: "Do not be anxious: you still possess the gold
circlets that weigh on my ankles".

But all this quiet beauty, this extreme patience merely shows
the depth of emotion dedicated entirely to her husband. With his
unjust death, “that depth is lashed to a storm"[^unjust-death-emotion-dedication] of pathos and
passion.

[^unjust-death-emotion-dedication]: C. and H. Jesudasan, op. *cit*., 55.

And yet all these people who are in fact not guilty, confess their
guilt: Mātavi, Kōvalaṉ, the king, and even Kaṇṇaki. And this is
what makes *Cilappati kāram* the supreme masterpiece of Tamil
poetry. *tan tītu ila!*... *en tītu enre*... “She did no wrong. I alone am
to blame", says Kōvalaṉ when he reads a letter from Mātavi
(Canto 13). But Mātavi confesses her guilt by the act of renunciation;
she, who was so fond of the *éclat* of the king's court, who loved
gold and jewels and extravagant life above all-she atones for her
guilt by becoming a nun and persuading the daughter she bore
Kōvalaṉ (Maṇimēkalai) to be a nun as well.

The king is shocked by his own deed and exclaims: *yāṇē kaļvan*…..
*ketuka en ayu!* "I am the robber... Let me die!" And he is killed
by remorse (Canto 20).

But Kaṇṇaki says in Canto 20: "I too am guilty of great sins",
and, again (Canto 29): *tennavan tītilan* “The king of the South has
not committed crime". And in Canto 23: "Alas, I am guilty of a
great crime".

Fate is of course everywhere in the poem. It occurs in all crucial
moments; in Canto 7, when Kōvalaṉ and Mātavi part: “Inspired
by fate, for whom the harp appeared a suitable pretext, he gradually
withdrew his hand from her body".

Before departure for Maturai, Kōvalaṉ is "inspired by fate"
to start at once; and again: “they left, / impelled by fate that had
devised for ages past their final destiny."

But there seems to be an inner tension between the conception
of Fate, of the *karmic* and *dharmic* interpretation of events, and
between Kaṇṇaki's actions. Out of the shock and pain which she has
experienced when told about Kōvalaṉ's murder, an unforeseen,
painful skepsis is born in her mind (“Is there no god? Is there no god
in this country? Is there no god, no god?" in Canto 19). But, almost
at once, there is a tremendous resolution: first, to know the truth;
then, to perform an act of justice. And when this is accomplished,
Kaṇṇaki goes on to fight that very Fate, to fight against the very
basis of the philosophical and religious ideology which lies at the
bottom of the work: "I wish neither to sit nor sleep nor stop, until
I see the husband dear to my heart." And she finally succeeds: she
compells the forces of *karma* to give up, and so Kōvalaṉ and
Kaṇṇaki are reunited.

"Then heaven's king, with all his angels, thought the time had
come to proclaim the saintliness of this woman, whose name men
shall ever recall. He showered down a rain of never-fading flowers,
then appeared and bowed at her feet."[^danielou-reunited]

[^danielou-reunited]: Transl. A. Daniélou (1965).

Let us once more return to the tragedy itself, to its roots and
causes: is it true that *Cilappatikāram* is a social tragedy rather than
a personal one? The fall of a society which cut in twain art and chastity,
and family women, made custodians of charity and love, were
set into contrast to public women--the custodians of art, leaving
thereby no room for such men as Kōvalaṉ, aspiring for both art and
love? It is one possible explanation, suggested by T. P. Meenakshisundaran
in his lectures on Tamil literature.[^tpm-blames-society-not-individual] It finds support in
the fact that Kaṇṇaki and Mātavi are set into a significant contrast
by the poet: Kaṇṇaki is unripe, naive, unsophisticated, reticent;
whenever she speaks, she is an illustration of *maṭamai,* simplicity
and naiveté; she is lovely, but not charming; after her unfolding
and transformation, she becomes the illustration of *marakkarpu,*
"stern, heroic chastity". In contrast, Mätavi speaks a lot, knows
how to read and write, is literate and cultured, she sings, dances,
plays on musical instruments; she is charming, sophisticated,
witty, gay, even brilliant.

[^tpm-blames-society-not-individual]: T. P. Meenakshisundaran, *HTL*, p. 40.

The burning of Maturai is, according to this view of the epic, the
symbol of the downfall of the society which splits womanhood.

Another important matter to discuss is the anklet, the *cilampu*,
which is so very important, so pivotal in the story and its symbolism
that it gave the epic its name: *cilampu + atikāram >Cilappatikāram*
"The Lay about the Anklet".

In the beginning, when she was happy after her marriage, Kaṇṇaki
was wearing her anklets, a pair of them. But once her husband
deserted her and went to live with Mātavi, she no longer adorned
herself: "No anklets adorned her shapely feet" (Canto 4).

It is the anklets which are offered by Kaṇṇaki to Kōvalaṉ and
he accepts them (Canto 9) to sell them in Maturai and start a new
life there. Thus it is the anklets that "drive" them, so to say, to
Maturai.

It is one of the two anklets which, in Canto 16, becomes the
instrumental cause of Kövalan's death. It is the anklet which is
broken open and thus proves Kōvalaṉ's innocence (Canto 20).

However, there seems to be still deeper meaning in the symbol of
the anklets.

First of all, the breaking of the anklet in Canto 20 ("The ankle
bracelet was brought and placed before the king. Kaṇṇaki seized it
and broke it open. A ruby sprang up into the king's face. When he
saw the stone, he faltered. He felt his parasol fallen, his sceptre
bent") is symbolic of *the* specific truth and of *truth* in general, truth
which breaks through, which is, ultimately, always revealed. Does
not, however, the round anklet and the breaking of it symbolize
more than that? The circle of the story, of the plot, and of Fate,
must be, and is completed; the *cilampu*, the anklet, comes to the
Pāṇḍya's court, the circle is completed (Kōvalan murdered, the
king and queen die, the Pāṇḍya capital burnt) and the round anklet
is broken: the human story tragically ends here. What follows is
another story a divine tale, the story of Kaṇṇaki's apotheosis.

And there is yet another symbolism connected with the anklets:
in a way, the pair of them is symbolic of the married couple's
happiness. While she was happy with Kōvalaṉ, Kaṇṇaki wore her
bracelets; when he left her, she wore none; when he returned, she
wore only *one*, because the marriage was no longer a perfectly
happy and "whole" marriage. And it is very significant for this
symbolism of the cilampu that, at the beginning of Canto 19, the
remaining anklet which Kaṇṇaki holds in hand, is called "*mate* to
the one she had given to Kövalan." At the very end of the poem,
in Canto 29, Kaṇṇaki, united with Kōvalaṉ in heaven, again wears
*both* anklets. King Cenkuṭṭuvan says: "In the sky, a marvellous
vision..! A woman, slender as a lightning-flash..! Gold circlets
gleam at her ankles!"[^anklets-contemporary-ritual]

[^anklets-contemporary-ritual]: For anklets in contemporary ritual, cf. T. P. Meenakshisundaran, HTL
42 "In the Tamil temples big anklets made of bronze are held in the hand
and moved so that the sound of the rolling stones inside may keep time to
the songs sung in praise of the deity. It is thus clear that there is an intimate
connection between the symbol of the anklet and the story of Kaṇṇaki, the
chaste woman".

Apart from the fact that *Cilappatikāram* is a great masterpiece
of narrative and lyrical poetry, it contains the essence of old Tamil
culture, and, like other epics, it portrays whole civilization. It
stands at the very end of its first bloom, gilded by the rays of the setting
sun of that early era which was doomed to end soon after the poem
was composed, with the tremendous changes that occurred in the
Tamil land under the Pallavas.
