# ANALYSING CLASSICAL POETRY

*The Metre*

The entire corpus of earlier classical poetry is composed in two
metres: [^classical-prosody] *akaval* and *vaňci*.

The basic metrical unit [^metrical-unit] is the *acai,* [^acai] which is of two types: the
*nēr* and the niṟai. The *nĕr* is a simple metrical unit, long or short,
which may or may not be followed by a consonant, that is (C) V (C).
We designate it by The niṟai is a compound metrical unit, made
up of two short syllables, or a short followed by a long syllable,
with or without a consonant following, i.e. (C) VCV (C). We symbolize
the *niṟai* by We see that the *nēr* may be quantitatively
long or short, whereas the first, initial syllable of a *niṟai* is always
short; in terms of Western notation, then, a *nēr* is always (a
macron), while a *niṟai* may be (pyrrhic) or
(iambic).[^ner-nirai]

If either of these two are followed by -u or by the "overshort" *-u,*
they become *nērpu* and niraipu, i.e. modified *nēr* and *niṟai*. This
does not apply to cases where the -u follows a single short syllable,
whence it becomes not a *nērpu* but a *niṟai.* [^nerpu-nirai] The possible combinations
of these four units (*nēr, nērpu, niṟai,* niraipu) are sixteen. And
all of them are permitted in the *akaval* metre. The most common
combinations are or *tēmā,* or *pulimā, kuvilam* and
*karuvilam*. These combinations form the next level in the
metrical structure the level of the *cir* "feet”. The feet proper to
the *akaval* are termed *iyaṟcīr* or “natural feet”, also *āciriyaccīr* or
"feet proper to the *āciriyam* (= *akaval*) metre".

[^classical-prosody]: For the most recent treatment of Tamil classical prosody, cf. K. Zvelebil,
An *Introduction* to *Tamil Classical Prosody,* Hoe & Co., Madras, 1972.

[^metrical-unit]: Some writers translated *acai* as "syllable" which is incorrect (cf. the
criticism of this term by J. R. Marr, op. cit. 273). *acai* is not a syllable,
neither is it a mora. Vithianathan translates it as "quantitative unit of a
movement" (op. cit. 273), Kailasapathy as "basic metrical unit" (op. *cit*.
140). I hesitated for some time between "prosodic” or “metrical syllable"
and some kind of "unit", and then, after discussing the matter with J. R.
Marr, decided for "fundamental" or "basic metrical unit".

[^acai]: Cf. *DED* 39: *acai* "to move, stir, etc.".

[^ner-nirai]: Cf. J. R. Marr, op. cit. 415.

[^nerpu-nirai]: E.g. in the words *karu* = and *mulu* =.



The combination of feet constitutes a line of poetry, termed *aṭi*.
The standard line consists of four feet. Although there are lines of
two, five etc. feet, the ideal line is that of four feet and hence is
called *alavaṭi* or "measured line".

In the *akaval* or *āciriyam* metre, the standard line has four feet
(= eight *acai*). Only the penultimate line consists of three feet.
Elsewhere, a three-feet line is exceptional.[^three-feet-line]

The *vaňci* metre (which occasionally occurs with the *akaval* in the
songs of the *Pattuppāṭṭu* anthology) has a somewhat different
scheme. The *vaňci* foot is made of three *acais*, e.g.
― = —
*nērnirai-*
*nēr*. The possible combinations of the four *acais* are sixty for the
*vaňcippā*. The usual *vaňci* line has two feet, so that it usually has
six *acais*. The last line in a *vaňci* stanza may be in *akaval.*

The next (and for our purposes the final) important concept to
discuss is the *toṭai,* lit. “connexion, joining”, “fastening, tying”,
"series, succession", i.e. the art of joining the lines of a poem in
succession, making use of "rhyme", alliteration, assonance, contrast
etc.[^nokku] The line is considered by indigenous theoreticians as the basic
and self-contained unit, in fact, as the largest single unit in a poem.
According to Pērāciriyar, “the poet completes the intended meaning
in each line; he does not need another line". *Toṭai* is precisely the
art of stringing together lines so that they constitute a song. There
are various kinds of *toṭai.* For our purposes, we shall mention just
two: *etukai* and *mōnai. Etukai* is the "consonance" in the coda of the
first closed syllables in the feet, e.g. in *peru* (1st line)... *aru* (2nd
line), the -- is the seat of *etukai* ; in *pāṭu* (1st line). . *kōṭi* (2nd line),
the -- is the seat of *etukai*. *Mõnai* is alliteration, like in *māyōṇ*
*mārpil* or *paranta pāṭi*.

*Specimen Analysis*
The basic prosodic and rhetoric features of classical Tamil poetry
will now be demonstrated through the analysis of three selected
poems.

[^three-feet-line]: It was very probably rightly suggested by John R. Marr (op. cit. 464)
that the three-feet penultimate line in *akaval* might have indicated the approaching
end of a song. Kailasapathy (op. cit. 143-143) suggests an analogy
of the penultimate line to the cadence in a musical composition.

[^nokku]: The next constituent is nōkku “gaze, look, view", i.e. the cohesion of the
various elements into one single whole; Kailasapathy says that it connects
"the smooth flow of meaning" (op*. cit.* 146).


*Kuṟuntokai* 119 (by Catti Nātaānr)

>|      *ciruvel laravi navvarik kuruļai*
>|      *kāna yānai yanṇańki yāan*
>|      *kiļaiyaṇ muļaivā ļeyirraļ*
>|      *valaiyuṭaik kaiyaḍem maṇanki yōļē*

In literal translation, this means:

>|      "little-white-snake of lovely-striped young-body
>|      jungle elephant troubling like
>|      the young-girl sprouts-brightness toothed-female
>|      bangle(s) possessing hand(s)-female".

In A.K. Ramanujan's charming translation:

>|       As a little white snake
>|       with lovely stripes on its young body
>|       troubles the jungle elephant
>|       this slip of a girl
>|       her teeth like sprouts of new rice
>|       her wrists stacked with bangles
>|       troubles me.
>|
>|       ---
>|       (The *Interior Landscape*, 1967)

The prosodic pattern is as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 40%">
＝ － / ＝ － / － ＝ / ＝ － <br>
－ － / － － / ＝ － / － － <br>
＝ － / ＝ － / ＝ － <br>
＝ ＝ / － ＝ / ＝ － / － －
</div>

We observe in this stanza four lines of four feet, the penultimate
line has three feet; the metre contains only feet of two metrical
units *(acai*) each, of the pattern ＝ －, － ＝, － － and ＝ ＝; these
feet are called *īr acai cīr* “two-unit-feet”. The metre is therefore
*akaval* or *āciriyam*.

As for the *toṭai,* there is e.g. a *etukai* or “consonance" between the
3rd and 4th line (*i/ḷ/aiyaḷ—va|ḷ|ai*), and there is, e.g., a *mōṉai* or
"alliteration" in the 2nd line: */y/āṉai* */y/aṇaṅki* */y/āaṅ(ku)*.

Now for the phonaesthetic analysis: almost all consonants belong
to the nasal (so-called *mellinam*) or liquid (*iṭaiyinam*) series; the
most favoured is the retroflex liquid *ḷ* which occurs 8 times. The
occlusives are rare: *c* occurs only once, there is no *t*, *k* as a tense stop
occurs only 3 times. This consonantal structure of the stanza results
in a soft, mellifluous, liquid effect, like the murmur of a mountain
stream. The distribution of the sounds is also interesting; each line
has its own specific phonic structure, resulting in a specific phonaesthetic
impression:


1. \(c\) ṟ v ḷḷ r v (ṉ) vv r (kk) r ḷ
2. k ṉ y ṉ y ṇ ṅk y ṅ(k)
3. ḷ y(ḷ) m ḷ v ḷ y ṟṟ ḷ
4. v ḷ y ṭ (kk) y ḷ mm ṇ ṅk y ḷ

Observe the various patterns in consonantal sequences in terms of
feet. Given enough space one could discern similar patterns with
regard to the vowels. Every stanza-every line, to be precise, since
the line is a finished and self-contained unit-has its own phonic
structure which is *functional.* The functional status of phonaesthetic
properties, of "orchestration" (instrumentovka), is one of the
very important and characteristic features of classical Tamil poetry.
Much later, there comes a period in the development of Tamil
literature when like in most literatures--the purely formal qualities
become the most important features of a poem (e.g. in medieval and
late medieval devotional literature). Not so, however, in early old
Tamil classical texts: there, the formal side is most often-though
not always in perfect unity with the thought-content, and hence
the purely formal aspect of the poems is fully functional.

Next the rhetoric analysis in terms of traditional Tamil poetics,
i.e. in terms of the first and most ancient descriptions of these
matters as preserved in Iṟaiyaṉār's *Akapporuḷ* and in the 3rd part
of *Tolkāppiyam (Poruļatikāram)*.

The two fundamental genres which were mentioned several times
before are the *akam* “love” and *puṟam* “war”. It is obvious that our
poem belongs to *akam* poetry. Within the *akam* genre, the first
dichotomy runs between well-matched love *(akam* proper) and
ill-matched love. Our poem belongs to the genre of well-matched
love (see detailed discussion later). Akam proper is subdivided into
five erotic situations, five phases of love, which are matched with
the physiographic regions; these are the five *tiṇais*. Our *tiṇai* is
called *kuṟiňci* or "lovers union", appropriate to the mountainous
region.

How can we tell?

In every classical Tamil poem, diagnostic features are present
which, to an informed listener and reader, reveal immediately the
type of *tiṇai* and theme in which the poem is composed. Sometimes
they are abundant. Sometimes, they are only a few. They are
conventional and traditional. There is great fixity, great stylization.
The poet is obliged to abide by traditions. The bardic practice


-both in the *akam* and in the *puṟam* genres-is conditioned by
traditional material. The inner tension, the very dynamism of
classical Tamil poetry arises out of this relation between the
traditional materia represented by conventions and formulae, and
the poet's art of improvisation. As Kailasapathy observes, simultaneous
freedom and limitation constitute the dynamism of Tamil
classical poetry. Now what is this traditional and conventionalized
matter in our particular poem? What are the diagnostic features?
First, there are some elements of the so-called *karupporuḷ* present
here, i.e. of "things born" or "native": the strata of *karupporuḷ!* is
represented by the "snake" *(aravu*) and by the "jungle elephant"
*(kana yanai*); that is by the beasts typical for the mountainous
region (*kuriňci*). The word *kāṇam* "jungle, forest" also belongs to
this strata. As far as the uripporuḷ is concerned, or the strata which
deals with human situations and feelings, the key-word is *aṇaňku*
"trouble"; "be troubled, afflicted, suffer pain", "afflict"-a feeling
typical again for the *kuṟiňci* situation. The "troubles" or "sufferings
of love" belong to the characteristic behavioural features of the
"mountain-poetry" (union of lovers). There are no other elements
of conventions present in the poem; but these four catch-words or
key-items (snake, elephant, forest, and afflictions of love) are
sufficient and diagnostic. This is the basic traditional and conventional
material around which the poem has been built. The presence
of representative features of all conventions is certainly not obligatory.
But some *must* be present. This is the kind of limitation
imposed on the poet: first, the broadest frame-he may decide
between love (*akam*) or war (*puram*) as his two main themes; now,
if he decides for love, he again has a binary choice: well-matched or
ill-matched. Within *akam* proper, he has to make his choice among
the five situations; and after he has chosen one, he is obliged to
give clues in terms of *mutal* or "First things", and/or karu or
"Native things" and/or *uri* or "Appropriate human feelings". He
is also expected to use the technique of direct and indirect comparison
and suggestion (inference). Within this framework, he is
relatively free.

As far as the last point is concerned: in the poem under analysis,
the comparison is rather explicit; actually, the whole poem is a
wonderful simile (made explicit by the use of comparative particle
*anku* "similarly, of that nature; like, as"): the lover-a jungle
elephant (*kāna yānai*); the sweetheart-a small young snake: no
real danger for the mighty elephant; and yet--she troubles and
afflicts him, by her elusiveness, mockery, and who knows what.
There is also the *technique* of *suggestion* used here, or rather comparison
by suggestion, which is not apparent at first sight and which
requires knowledge of some cultural traits: the *avvari* "lovely
stripes" at the body of the snake hint at the fair lines, stripes and/or
dots (vari) which were considered to be marks of beauty on the body
of a woman (particularly on her breasts and venus' mound).
Let us now analyse another poem, *Kuṟuntokai* 3, ascribed to
Tēvakulattār. First the original Tamil text again:

>|       *nilattinum* peritē *vāninu muyarntanru*
>|       *nīriņu māraļa vinrē cărar*
>|       *karunkōr kuriйcip pūkkoṇṭu*
>|       peruntē nilaikkum *nāṭanoṭu natpē*
>|       
>|       'earth-than big(ger), sky-than high(er)
>|       water-than hard(er)-to-fathom mountain-slope
>|       black-stalk-*kuriйci*-flower(s) taking
>|       rich-honey-making-country's-lord-with love'.
>|       
>|       Bigger than earth, certainly,
>|       higher than the sky,
>|       more unfathomable than the waters
>|       is this love for this man
>|           of the mountain slopes
>|           where bees make rich honey
>|           from the flowers of the *kuṟiňci*
>|           that has such black stalks.
>| 
>|       ---
>|       (A. K. Ramanujan, The *Interior Landscape*, 1967)

Metric analysis will tell us that this is a poem of the same structure
as the one preceding: four lines, each of four feet, the penultimate
line has three feet; feet of two and three metrical units are used.
This kind of stanza (which is technically known as *nēricai āciriyap-*
pā) seems to have been the earliest type of stanza in the *akaval*
metre, and hence the earliest type of stanzaic structure extant in the
language. The metric patterns are
Before we go into the rhetoric analysis, let us observe yet another
property which many or most of these early Tamil poems composed
as nēricai āciriyappās have: they are divided, from the point of
thought-content *and* form, into two parts: the first part, usually
longer (purely quantitatively; in a 4-line stanza, the first 2 lines,
sometimes part of the 3rd line), deals with the *mutal* and/or karupporuḷ,
i.e. with the time-space continuum as basic background, and
with the concrete representations of the five-fold physiographic
regions in *Kur*. 119, we have in those lines the snake and the
elephant; in this stanza, we have in the first 2 lines the earth, the
sky, the waters, the mountain-slopes, and the 3rd line, too, is filled
with the *karupporuḷ* material: the black-stalked *kuṟiňci* flowers.
The second part, usually shorter (in a 4-line stanza it usually begins
in the penultimate 3-feet line, or sometimes only in the very last line)
contains the substance of the poem, its essence (*uripporul*), the
pointe: in *Kur*. 119, the human element appears in the 3rd line, and
the essential feeling (the trouble of love) as the last word of the 4th
line; in *Kur*. 3, the human element occurs only in the very last line
*(nātan*), and the *pointe,* the essential feeling, again as the very last
word of the whole stanza (*naṭpē* “love”).

This kind of structure gives to the classical Tamil stanzas a
wonderful conciseness, terseness, pithiness and an inner tension
which is resolved usually at the very end of the stanza. Sometimes,
though, the procedure is exactly opposite, and the same effect is
achieved by a reverse technique: the *pointe,* the essence of the poem
is revealed in the very first line, it is a sort of direct attack on the
listener; and what follows, is a kind of “decrescendo”, an unfolding
of the *pointe*. But always, in the best stanzas of the collections
*(tokai*), in both genres, *akam* and *puṟam*, there is a very conscious
striving after a perfect and extremely potent and effective *form*.

The genre of *Kur.* 3 is *akam* or love, clearly well-matched love or
*akam* proper; the basic theme-*tinai*-is *kuṟiňci* or lover's union.
The time-space continuum is not explicitly given in this poem;
neither is it implicit in some suggestion or other. However, according
to some interpretations, the main components of the place or
*nilam* subdivision of the *mutal* are earth, water, fire, wind and sky;
and in this particular poem, three of them, earth, sky and water are
actually mentioned, to stress the greatness and depth and intensity
of the heroine's love. As far as the *karupporuḷ* or concrete representations
of the physiographic regions are concerned, we have here no
gods, but the term *nāṭan* for the lover; this is a specific term used
for the chief of the mountain-tribe, so that this in itself provides the
clue for the *tiṇai*; second, among the birds and beasts and insects,
we have, implicitly, the bees, in the sphere of flora we have the
*kuṟiňci* flower, and honey which stands for the bees, being the
typical conventional apparatus of the "mountain-poetry". The
uripporuḷ or the psychological essence is represented by the word
*naṭpu* "love". According to some commentaries, the attributes
*karunkōl* "black-stalked" and *perunten* "rich honey" belong to
so-called iṟaicci or suggestion (or inference) in form of some additional
material, as qualifier or adjunct to some basic concept: the
*kuṟiňci* flowers with black stalks stand for the woman in love; the
bees gathering honey from these flowers are supposed to stand for
the man's action of gathering sweetness from the pleasure of the
lover's union. As in the previous poem, the comparison is explicit,
made overt by the use of the ablative plus -um: "big(ger) *than* earth,
high(er) *than* sky" etc. What is compared is the intensity, the depth
and greatness of the heroine's *naṭpu*, love.

Finally, a third poem, from the same *tokai*, collection, *Kuṟuntokai*
68, ascribed to Aḷḷur Nanmullai. I abstain this time from quoting
the original. Here is Ramanujan's lovely translation:

>|       The bare root of the bean is pink
>|       like the leg of a jungle hen,
>|       and herds of deer attack its overripe pods.
>|       
>|       For the harshness of this early frost
>|       there is no cure
>|       
>|       but the breast of my man.
>|
>|       ---
>|       (The *Interior Landscape*, 1967)

The genre is obviously *akam,* love, and *akam* proper, or wellmatched
love. The tiṇai is a mixed one; and this is no chance, nor
an error on the part of the poet. How do we know it is a mixed
"poetic situation"? As far as the time-space continuum is concerned,
the poem mentions explicitly "early frost" (this comes under
*kālam*, time): “early dew" is typical for *kuṟiňci* or “lover's union".
Now to the "things native" or "concrete representations": the
bird mentioned is the jungle hen, typical for *mullai* or forest,
appropriate to "patient waiting" in terms of the phases of love;
the beast mentioned is the deer, again typical for *mullai* or the
"patient waiting" situation. The "bean" also belongs to *mullai*.
The *uripporuḷ* or essential human feeling is defined as "memory and
desire": that is, “memory of lovers' union" (*kuriňci*) and “desire of
patient waiting" (*mullai*): the *tiṇai* of this poem, the “situation" is
thus kuṟiňci *mullai*, a *mixed* tiṇai, a mixed situation. There is,
again, an explicit comparison present (the pink root of the bean
compared to the leg of the jungle hen). But there is also suggestion
and inference in this stanza: the bare root of the bean, pink and
attacked by herds of deer in the "season of early dew" is suggestive
of the bare body and soul of the waiting, pining woman, attacked
by memories of union and longing for embrace.

Finally, I give four different translations of one and the same
poem, *Kuṟuntokai* 25, ascribed to the great Kapilar (the poem
belongs to the finest classical Tamil poems ever composed) to show
the various problems, difficulties and solutions involved in translating
Old Tamil poetry.
