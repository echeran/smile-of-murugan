# Origins Of Modern Tamil Prose. The Historical And The Theoretical Problem

The problem of the origin of modern Tamil prose- -as seen from
a necessarily simplified perspective-is a twofold one: first, purely
historical; and second, theoretical.

The first part of the problem means to trace down and find out,
to list, analyze, classify and explain the external causes and conditions
accelerating or mitigating the origins and development of
modern prose. The second part of the problem means to answer a
basic theoretical question: is prose, as belletristic writing, as a form
of creative literature, basically alien to Tamil (and Indian) culture,
and could and did it arise and develop only under predominant
foreign impact—or not?

I shall not at all attempt to answer these questions, to solve
these problems. There are unfortunately almost no valid Vor*arbeiten*
in this field, and only very recently Tamil scholars themselves
have begun to search for answers to these questions.[^two-books-to-mention]

[^two-books-to-mention]: The two books in Tamil that probably deserve to be mentioned in this
connection are K. Kailasapathy's *Tamil nāval* ("Tamil Novel"), Pāri
Nilaiyam, Madras, 1968, and Mu. Vai. Aravintan's *uraiyāciriyarkaḷ* (“The
Commentators"), Madras, 1968.

In this chapter I shall try to arrange some facts reflecting the
external and internal factors pertaining to the origins of modern
Tamil prose, especially as far as printing and journalism in 19th
Century Tamilnad is concerned.

Among the external historical factors we have to distinguish
purely historical and political factors, external cultural factors, and
external ideological factors.

The expansion of French and British rule from the coastal cities
of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras etc., ultimately brought a kind of
peace and order after decades of disorder, fighting and strife. It
also brought new system of law, it codified indigenous law, it
brought opportunity for new jobs etc., and there is no wonder that
Indian intellectuals in general welcomed the new *Pax Britannica*.
The introduction of the then modern science, of the Western conception
of humanistic studies, of ideas of “enlightenment” etc. played
an enormous role in the development of indigenous cultures. On
the other hand, we must not forget the immense influence which the
work of early Western Indologists had on the intellectual élite of
India their editions and translations of ancient Indian texts were
often a kind of revelation to the Indians themselves. They brought
them better knowledge of their own cultural traditions; and the
praise and admiration shown by Westerners aroused in Indians
legitimate pride in their own heritage.

The most important of the external ideological factors was—in
the 18th and early 19th Centuries—the confrontation with Christianity.
Especially in the South of India there was massive missionary
activity, both Catholic and Protestant. This confrontation meant,
on the one hand, practical acceptance of parts of Christian doctrine
and ethics,[^christian-poets] but, at the same time, strong defence and resistance
against it. The Hindus saw a model which they could adopt for
methods and techniques of their own propaganda and education.

[^christian-poets]: We have in Tamil such early Christian poets as Henry Albert Krishna
Pillai (1827-1900), whose Christian hymns are formally based on the *Tēvāram*.

More specifically, in Tamil India (as elsewhere, e.g. in Bengal),
there was great need felt by the British administrators to learn the
"vernacular". The old Portuguese and Latin grammars were inaccessible,
dated or incomprehensible, and indigenous grammars
―anyhow not available yet in print-would be of no use for the
beginners. So the first "modern" grammars of Tamil began to appear,
written partly in Tamil prose, partly in English. Probably the first
of these printed grammars for wider use was *A Tamel Expositor* by
Teroovorcaudoo Subroya Mudaliar, printed at Madras A.D. 1811.[^early-british-appreciation-tamil]
In 1812, the College of Fort St. George was founded in Madras. In
this institution (closed on July 21, 1854), Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam,
Kannada and Urdu were taught by indigenous teachers, the
munshis. First principals of this College were Englishmen, Ellis
and Mackenzie, but later they also included Indians, like Muttusami
Pillai, and this College was in fact the first centre of Westernoriented
Tamil scholarship. The first influential Tamil scholars of
the first half of the 19th Cent. all taught or were in some way
connected with the College: Tandavaraya Mudaliyar, Muttusami
Pillai and others.

[^early-british-appreciation-tamil]: The early British administrators, missionaries etc. were much impressed
by Tamil culture. W. Taylor: "(Tamil) is one of the most copious, refined
and polished languages spoken by man" (quoted by G. E. Gover, The FolkSongs
of *Southern* India, Madras, 1871, viii-ix). P. Percival: "Perhaps no
language combines greater force with equal brevity; and it may be asserted
that no human speech is more close and philosophic in its expression as an
exponent of the mind" (quoted ib.). E. Hoole: "God 'left not Himself
without witness' among the Tamil people. . . The acquisition of the language
in which the remains of Tamil wisdom are preserved is no easy task.
Aptitude, genius, industry, perseverance, are necessary to the Tamil scholar"
(E. J. Robinson, *Tamil* Wisdom, With an Introduction by the late Rev.
Elijah Hoole, London, 1873, ix-x).

Another important institution where the contacts of Western
and Tamil culture took place daily was the office of the dubashis,
the interpreters.

Among early French and British administrators, the need soon
arose for various lists, inventories, catalogues, registers, accounts,
chronicles etc., in Tamil, besides having them in French or English.

All these and similar factors had a definite trigger-effect accelerating
the development of Tamil prose, adequate for such purposes.

As far as the classical and medieval Tamil texts were concerned,
there was relative ignorance of them among the people. Only the
traditional scholar, sometimes in private, sometimes in *mutts,* kept
the knowledge alive. One of the reasons for this relative ignorance
was the fact that all literary works were either in the manuscript
form, or existing only in scholarly oral transmission, neither of
these traditional channels accessible to the majority of common
people. There were no really live centres of literary and cultural
activities. For a few centuries, owing to political and religious
reasons, Sanskrit, Urdu, Marathi and Telugu seem to have been
more prestigious and important than Tamil even in Tamilnad. This
is no speculation. We actually have records and accounts of the
fact that Tamil as a literary language was neglected, while the other
languages were decidedly preferred: cf. the complaints of Paṭikkācu
Pulavar, a bard of the 17th Cent., who made himself acquainted
with this deplorable state of affairs during his wanderings all over
the country.

In the monasteries or *mutts*, it was a scholastic, highflown type
of compositions which were produced, under a very strong impact
of Sanskrit; in the 18th Cent., one may observe slight beginnings
of a reaction against the over-all Sanskritization upheld by such
overbearing Sanskrit enthusiasts as Swaminatha Desikar.

One important factor in the origin of modern prose seems to
be the fact that traditional forms of literary expression became
inadequate to express new ideas and new emotions, but, above all,
to meet new demands and new needs, in fact, to express the entire
process of the confrontation of the two cultures.

However, the most important external factors, playing an almost
all-decisive part in the origin of modern and popular prose in
Tamilnad and in India, were printing and journalism.

The very beginnings of printing, sporadic both in time, space
and output, were all connected with missionary activities. Here
was the origin of Gonzalves' *Kiristuvavaṇakkam* (1577),[^british-museum-first-tamil-book] one of
the first if not the first book printed in India, Philip de Melho's
Tamil *New Testament* printed in 1749 etc. The two most important
early printing establishments in the South were founded at Ambalakkadu
(since 1679) and in Tranquebar (1712-13). However, it was
only the massive spread of printing, beginning in Tamil India
roughly after 1835, which played such a decisive role in the origin
and development of modern prose.

[^british-museum-first-tamil-book]: According to Albertine Gaur of the British Museum, the first Tamil
printed book was a translation of Francis Xavier's Doutrina Christe by
Henrique Henriques, published in 1578 in Goa, cf. "European Missionaries
and the Study of Dravidian Languages", *Proceed.* of *the* I *Intern*. Conference
*Seminar* of *Tamil* Studies, Vol. II, Kuala Lumpur, 1969, pp. 322-328.

On August 3rd, 1835, a law was passed which abolished the
previous acts of 1823, 1825 and 1827 concerning printing and
publishing of books. Printing was brought under direct surveillance
of magistrates and thus a kind of censorship was established
(disobeying the law resulted in a fine of Rs 5000 and/or 2 years'
imprisonment); on the other hand, this law institutionalized and
legalized printing, and it gave an exactly defined obligatory form
to everything which was to be published. The full text of the new
law which formed article 11 of the 1835 Act was published in Fort
St George Gazette in English, Tamil, and the other languages
of Madras.

What was, however, most important was the fact that the law
enabled Indians to own pressworks. Previously, almost all printing
works were owned by Catholic and Protestant missions, and, apart
from dictionaries, grammars and textbooks, they naturally printed
their own kind of Christian propaganda material to the exclusion
of everything else.

The fact that since 1835 Indian ownership of printing establishments
was legalized had naturally a tremendous impact, and the
results were to be seen very soon: first, old Tamil texts began to
be published and this rediscovery of ancient Tamil culture ultimately
led to the "Tamil Renaissance"; second, the development of modern
prose took a new and vigorously different turn.

It was of course a great novelty to have old venerated texts which
had so far been known only to the elite either through oral transmission
from *guru* to *chela,* or written on palm-leaves which were
almost unavailable, printed and published in a great number of
copies which were cheap and easy to obtain. It was such a novelty
that many of the pandits who called this manner of treating old
literary texts *elutā eļuttu*, i.e. “unwritten script", actually opposed it.
One of the points which made tremendous difference between a
palm-leaf manuscript copy of a text and its printed edition was the
price. Thus e.g. according to John Murdoch, the Rev. P. Percival
paid (sometime before 1835) for a palm-leaf manuscript-copy of
Beschi's *Caturakarāti* 10 English pounds; when the same work was
printed after 1835, its price fell down to 2½ shillings.

The "rediscovery" of ancient Tamil literature occurred in the
transition period of the later 19th Century when-to use the happy
phrase of A. K. Ramanujan—“both paper and palm leaf were
used". The man most responsible for making possible the transition
was U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar (1855-1942), by editing and printing
the most important and inaccessible of ancient manuscripts. The
late medieval Saivite and Vaiṣṇavite scholars "apparently tabooed
as irreligious all secular texts which included the earliest and the
greatest of Tamil literary texts; they disallowed from study all
Jain and Buddhist texts ... Under this intellectual taboo, a great
scholar like Camiṇātaiyar had to give his nights and days to secondrate
religious and grammatical texts of the medieval period. He
was entirely unaware even of the existence of the twin epics and
the breath-taking poetic anthologies of Tamil literature, till he met
a liberal-minded *munsif* named Rāmacuvāmi Mutaliār. He records
the date as 1880, October 21, a Thursday- and all students of
Tamil literature should think of that date as ‘etched in red letters'".[^date-of-meeting]

[^date-of-meeting]: A. K. Ramanujan, *Language and "Modernization":* The *Tamil* Example,
University of Chicago, 1968. Xeroxed, Private Distribution Only. By courtesy
of the author.

It was *munsif* Ramaswamy who made Swaminatha Aiyar aware
of the existence of such texts as the *Cīvakacintāmaṇi* and the
*Cilappatikāram*, and even gave him a handwritten manuscript to
take home and read.[^ramasamy-gaves-cilappatikaram-to-saminathaiyar] Swaminatha Aiyar devoted then the rest of
his life to unearthing, editing and printing ancient Tamil literary
texts.

[^ramasamy-gaves-cilappatikaram-to-saminathaiyar]: U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar's *Autobiography* (in Tamil), *ed*. 1958, 326-43.

However, it seems that we should go at least twenty years back
for the true 'rediscoverer' of ancient Tamil literature. In 1868,
Rev. H. Bower, an Englishman, published the first book of
*Cīvakacintāmaṇi* (*Nāmakaļ Ilampakam*): *The Chintamani.* First *Book*
*Called Namagal Ilambagam*; with *the Commentary of Nachinarkiniyar,*
*and* with *analysis and notes* in English*, Tamil and* English *Indexes*,
*and* an *English Introduction explaining the Jaina system* on which
*the book is based; by Rev.* H. *Bower*, *with the assistance of E. Muttaiya*
*Pillai*. Printed by H. W. Laurie, at the Christian Knowledge
Society Press, No. 18, Church Street, Vepery, 1868. Bower's edition
was of a surprisingly high standard.[^bower-published-before-saminathaiyar]

[^bower-published-before-saminathaiyar]: Cf. S. Vaiyapuri Pillai, *Tamiḻc cutar maṇikaḷ,* 3rd ed. 1959, 296.

Without trying in any way to detract from the great merits due
to U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar, we have to justly admit that S. V.
Damodaram Pillai (1823-1901) deserves equal admiration and
gratitude for his editions of literary (e.g. *Kalittokai*, 1887) and
especially grammatical texts (e.g. *Viracōliyam*, 1881, Iṟaiyaṉār's
*Akapporuḷ,* 1883, Tolkāppiyam *Poruḷ.*, 1885). It was probably
Damodaram Pillai more than *anyone* else who started the search
after old manuscripts. Without doubt he was the one who was
first engaged in the rediscovery of the earliest classical literature.
Before him, probably nobody knew for sure about the existence
of an anthology called *Eṭṭuttokai*; pandits were not sure even of
the famous epic, whether it was *Cilappati kāram* or *Ciṟappatikāram*.
And worse than that: there were even doubts and suspicions as to
the genuine nature and authenticity of the ancient texts, so much
so that Damodaram Pillai had to write in a kind of self-defence:
"Śrīmat Căminātaiyar is my witness, as I am a witness to him".
Perseverance and modesty were the two most characteristic features
of this man, who was as great as Swaminatha Aiyar, but whose
greatness and merits have never been truly acknowledged.

It is impossible to give a chronological or a complete list of
printing works which published Tamil literature in the first half
of the 19th Cent. But after 1835, there was an enormous growth
of Indian-owned printing establishments in Madras and in Ceylon,
and foreign printers and the missions, too, began publishing Tamil
literature. According to preliminary and incomplete data, in the
first half of the 19th Cent., roughly until 1860, there were seventy
printers in Madras and in Ceylon, publishing in Tamil.

The appearance of printing and paper, the availability of printing
to Tamil editors, scholars and original authors after 1835, revolutionalized
the whole conception, the ways, methods and techniques of
writing, and was no doubt one of the two most decisive external
factors in the development of modern prose.

The second factor of utmost importance was the birth and
growth of Tamil journalism. The 19th Century is the century of
Tamil journalism.

At the beginning of the century, it were mission-owned and
government establishments that began publishing Tamil weeklies
and monthlies. The first, and at the same time typical of these
Christian-oriented Tamil journals was Tamilppattirikai (alias
*Tamilital),* established in 1831, a monthly, published by the Madras
Religious Tract Society.

In 1840, a Christian-oriented journal for children was started
in Nagarcoil, a quarterly under the name *Pālatīpikai* (stopped
publishing in 1852). In the same year, three other Tamil journals
were founded in Madras: *Missionary Glance* in Nagarcoil, *Friendly*
*Instructor* in Palamcottah, and *Tarpōtakam* in the same place.

About six or more weeklies to monthlies to quarterlies were
started between 1840-1855; in 1855, a very important weekly, the
*Tinavarttamani,* appeared for the first time. It was published every
Friday, and its founder and editor was Rev. P. Percival. Though
Christian in orientation, this was the first full-blooded Tamil
journal in its language, and in general atmosphere. It published
news, pieces of ancient literature(!), science, essays. It was supported
with 200 Rs of government money per month. After Percival left,
the editorship was taken over by Damodaram Pillai and later by
Viswanatha Pillai.

The first period of Tamil journalism, typical for its Christian,
missionary orientation,[^exception-in-early-tamil-journalism] and for the absence of dailies, came to an
end after 1880 with the foundation of *Cutecamittiran* (Swadeshamitran),
the excellent and well-known daily paper of Madras,
which, by its political outlook, language and cultural orientation
set up an entirely different and much higher standard for Tamil
journalism.

[^exception-in-early-tamil-journalism]: An exception was the *Tattuvapōtini*, founded in St Thome, Mylapore, in
1864 by the Madras Brahma Samaj, followed by *Vivēkavilakkam*, another
journal of the Samaj, in 1865.

Between 1831-1880, that is in about fifty years, roughly 46
weeklies, monthlies and quarterlies were founded in Madras Presidency.
Between 1880-1900, that is within twenty years alone,
approximately 60 Tamil dailies to quarterlies were born. This
number is rather impressive in itself. And starting with *Cutēcami-*
ttiran, there was place, in Tamil journalism, for regular newsediting,
for political and social satire, for regular essays, and, most
important of all, for the short story. Typical for the new type of
periodical, devoted more to literature and culture than anything
else was the monthly *Ňānapōtini*, published since 1897 in Madras
by M. S. Purnalingam Pillai, the author of the first history of Tamil
literature. The joint editor of this—for its time quite outstandingachievement
was Suryanarayana Sastri (1871-1903), a noted poet,
dramatist, journalist and scholar.

For any successful attack on the theoretical problem posed
above the origin and evolution of modern Tamil prose as suchwe
have to make a distinction between belletristic writing (prosefiction)
and all other types of prose; second, between direct influence
and an accelerating impulse, a trigger-like effect.

Well-spread in time, for about seven to eight centuries, there
had been a tremendous potential of Tamil prose in the writings of
the commentators: from the alliterative, highly ornamental prose
of a Nakkīrar to a comparatively simple descriptive style of Aṭiyārkkunallar;
there were short pieces of narrative prose as well as
heavy, ornate and very learned passages of some commentaries.
These sources were of course accessible only to a few individuals:
traditional pandits, antiquarians, foreign scholars. But it is exactly
these men who stand at the craddle of modern prose. Foreigners
like Roberto de Nobili and C. J. Beschi, traditional scholars like
Minakshisundaram Pillai (1815-1876).

Mināṭcicuntaram Pillai was an extremely prolific poet and
translator from Sanskrit, but his poetry[^minatcicuntaram-pillai-poetry] is now almost forgotten.
His enormous importance lies in the fact that he gathered round
himself a charmed circle of disciples-in the manner of a Samuel
Johnson and some of the most distinguished scholars and prosewriters
of Tamilnad owned their skill, enthusiasm and knowledge
to this fascinating man—the most noted among them perhaps
Thyagaraja Chettiar and U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar.

[^minatcicuntaram-pillai-poetry]: *22* *purāṇas*, *10* *pillaittamils*, *11* *antātis*, *2 kalampakams*, *7* *mālais*, *3*
*kovais*, *9* *ulās* and *1 līlai*.

For prose writing as such, however, a more important personality
was Āṟumuka Nāvalar (1822-1876) of Jaffna. The incentive for
his literary activities seems to have been the religious zeal of
Christian missionaries which provoked him to an attitude of fierce
defence. Soon a stream of powerful Tamil prose gushed out of him,
prose which was expressive, vigorous, and tolerably free of Sanskrit
influence though somewhat pedantic and dry. He established his
own press in Jaffna and the books which he published—though
containing perhaps childishly controversial matters-actually
meant the origin of modern Tamil prose-style. His prose is very
severe, spotlessly correct and very polished.[^saying-about-arumuka-navalar] He composed a Saiva
catechism, *Caivavināviṭai*, formally based on current Roman
Catholic catechisms. He was also the teacher of Percival, whom he
actively helped with his translation of the Bible into Tamil. For
the development of Tamil belletristic writing most important of
his contribution is probably his very readable rendering of the
*Periyapuraṇam* into prose.

[^saying-about-arumuka-navalar]: A current saying about him was *vaitālum valuvinṟi vaivārē*, "Even in
abuse he would speek faultlessly". Once, so the story goes, he went to the
bazaar to buy some coconuts and asked about the price in the following
manner: "*Ammaiye*, *nīvir tenkankāykaļai māral ennaṇamo*?" Unfortunately
this can be appreciated only by those who know at least some Tamil.

Apart from these men, and a host of others who were their
contemporaries and their successors, and who were nourished
basically by two sources, by the medieval commentators and by
early Christian missionary writings, there is yet another line of
development of modern Tamil prose, entirely independent of the
learned scholarly tradition.

This third line consists of prose which is a direct, simple and
charmingly naive reflection of the spoken language of the 18th
Century.

Anadarangam Pillai was born at Pirambūr near Madras in April 1709.
His father's brother-in-law, Nainiyappa Pillai, was a distinguished
citizen of Pondichéry, a wealthy merchant and a government
official in the French colony. He invited Tiruvengada Pillai, the
father of Anandarangam, to become his partner in business. The
newcomer did very well, indeed so well that he became divan of
Pondichéry. When he died, the divanship was for a short time in
the hands of a Kanagaraya Mudaliar, and when this man died,
the French East India Company transferred the office on Anandarangam
Pillai.

Under governor Joseph François Dupleix, Anandarangam acted
as the Prime Minister of the French colony. He invested his money
well in textile industries, printing, and merchandise of different
sort; he even owned a big ship by name of *Anandappuravi* which
carried his merchandise from European to Chinese ports. He was
also a patron of literature, and we have at least three panegyric
poems composed about him; one of these poems says that poets
were awaiting him as peacocks await the coming of rain-clouds,
as the *cakravāka* birds await the appearance of the moon, as the
lotus awaits the rising of the sun. He was liberal not only to poets
but also to temples, and founded a number of caravanserais and
choultries. In 1760 the British invaded Pondichéry. Four days
before this French-British war was over, on January 11, 1761,
Anandarangam died.

He left behind a diary which he began writing on September 6,
1736, under the governorship of Dupleix, as the divan of Pondichery
and the governor's dubashi, interpreter. It is one of the most important
documents ever written in the Tamil language: from state
secrets to small everyday trivia of family life, Anandarangam
Pillai has captured, sometimes in details, sometimes in an almost
shorthand style, the events of 25 years. Whatever he saw and heard,
without adding much of his own imagination, but very lively, and
obviously very truthfully: the joys and sorrows of his own household,
echoes of battles and policies in India and Europe, appointments
and withdrawals of French officials, goings and comings of
ships, festivals and ceremonies in temples and churches-it is as
if one would watch a documentary movie showing the life of French
Tamilnad in the middle of the 18th Century day by day.

As a historical source it is a fascinating mine of both trivial and
important data. As a piece of prose it makes sometimes charming,
sometimes boring reading. Some entries have dry, factological
character:

> "29th of April, 1745: \
> A ship from China by name of *Notre Dame* de *Sours*. The captain's
> name is M. Felicien de Sylva Medeiro. The ship brought sugar, groundnuts,
> candy, and other Chinese products. On the same day, a ship by
> name of *Lakshmana Prasad* arrived from Tennasserim, bringing 13
> elephants; the ship-master is Subha Singh". \
>
> "5th of June, 1743: \
> Today at four o'clock, they hanged, opposite the choultry, a thief who was caught thieving in the house of a muslim in Miraveli". \
>
> "3rd of Febr., 1743: \
> In the morning at 10 o'clock a ship named *Duc d'Orleans* departed for Europe. It carries bundles of washing sarees, one bunch of indigo silk sarees, many sacks of ground nut, of kindan, of cotton cloth etc. M. Coulard also went to Europe aboard this ship". \

But some of the entries read very well.

> "16th of Oct., 1745: \
> Today in the evening, the Christians with their wives-the Pariahs, \ Indians dressed in European garments, Whites and Tamils—all gathered at the place where they usually come to hear their *pūjā.* K. R. Mudaliyar's son Asarappa Mudaliar with his wife Selvam also came to the place where their religious ceremonies are held. The woman was all dressed in the garments of their caste; she was heavily perfumed with many odours and aromas; she had on a transparent muslin saree. When she approached the honourable padre who was very near to the Swami, and as she was kneeling deep in thought on the place where one hears the Christian *pūjā,* as soon as that cloud of perfumes hit the nose of the padre, he discarded the holy words and catching his nose he pricked her hair-knot with a rattan cane and shouted: 'Are you a married woman? Or are you a whore? Isn't your husband ashamed of you? To come to church with this muslin saree on-one can see your whole body, your breasts, and even your hairy orifice! Get up and home with you, you virtuous one, your mass is ended!"

All this is written in the most deliciously colloquial language
with a number of spelling errors which would offend any purist and
perfectionist; spontaneous, with a keen sense of minute observation,
here and there with a pinch of humour. A complete and good
translation of this book is badly needed.

Anandarangam Pillai's *Diary* is entirely independent of the
traditional line of high Tamil prose, and it has most probably
nothing to do either with any direct impetus from French of
English literature. It seems that the only classical work of Tamil
literature the divan knew was the *Tirukkuṟaḷ.* Naturally, he knew
many languages: besides Tamil, he knew Telugu, Urdu and French,
perhaps even English. But it seems that this knowledge was not
at all academic, but practical, day-to-day knowledge, and it is
almost certain that he did not know any of the literatures. His
*Diary* is a direct and spontaneous piece of prose-writing which had
only one model: life itself. And so is its language: the written form
of the day-to-day spoken Tamil of the 18th Century.

The reader was warned that an answer to the question pertaining
to the origin of modern Tamil belletristic prose would not be
attempted. A few suggestions will nevertheless be made in conclusion
of this chapter. As already stressed, potentially, Tamil
prose has always been present in Tamil literature. Since Tamil
literature starts with bardic creations, its first fruits were in form
of poetry. All the world over bards sang songs, i.e. composed poetry.
But, at the same time, the syntax and the lexis of ordinary prose
was developed in inscriptions. Even the *Tolkāppiyam* speaks of
prose literature consisting of riddles and proverbs (s. 1429). Short
narrative prose passages occurred in the *Cilappatikāram.*[^cilappatikaram-narrative-prose] Narrative
introductions to bardic songs were also in prose.[^bardic-song-intros-narrative-prose] Later, there is
some Sanskritized prose in Peruntēvaṇār's *Pāratam* (9th Cent.).
And, finally, we come to a large, lengthy literary work in Tamil
prose, the Śrīpurāṇam of Maṇṭalapuruṭar (prob. 16th Cent.), a
*purana* of the sixty-three Jaina saints. All these facts show that
there had always been in Tamil literature a perfectly adequate
capacity to develop prose-writing, that there had always been a
kind of accumulator of different prose-styles, narrative, descriptive,
factographic and eruditory, which could generate prose if need
arose.

[^cilappatikaram-narrative-prose]: E.g. the *uraiperu kaṭṭurai* is a piece of narrative prose. Another genuine
piece of prose-fiction contained in the epic is the *uraippaṭṭumaṭai* at the
beginning of Canto 29; in Daniélou's Engl. translation this part is found on
pp. 187-189 (the syntax of this particular piece of prose is indeed awkward
and cumbersome; the whole paragraph contains only one finite verb-form
and an endless number of adverbial participles and infinitives).

[^bardic-song-intros-narrative-prose]: E.g. the colophon to *Puṟam* 5.

The decisive impetus came with the tremendous impact of
Europe upon India which should not be underestimated (or even
rejected!). However, European influences were “more immediately
effective in the social sphere" and "much less formative in the
actual birth” of modern prose-fiction.[^birth-modern-prose-fiction] If need arose, prose could
be written easily-witness the eloquence of Anandarangam Pillai's
*Diary* which is, truly enough, predominantly documentary, facto1
graphic writing but which also contains elements of narrative prose
and description in its anecdotic passages (and, what is also important,
we do not know for sure that his is the only written document
of that type; rather, we may hope that one day more of such
"diaries" and similar documentary writings will be unearthed).
When one reads, therefore, that modern Tamil prose-fiction[^reinterpret-european-influence-tamil-prose-fiction] arose
and developed under decisive Western, European influence (and
sometimes this implies that without such influence it would have
never developed at all), one should bear in mind that this "influence"
should be rather understood more generally and broadly
as an “impact", for it was a diverse, far-reaching and long-term
effect[^european-influence-indirect-long-term-effect] rather than individual, direct and absolutely decisive influence.
On the other hand, it is significant, that--at least as far
as we know at this stage of our knowledge—the strong “mainstream"
out of which almost all if indeed not all modern Tamil prose developed
was the one strong current of scholarly, commentary-like,
severe, somewhat dry and pedantic prose of the *savant*, of the
scholiast, of the pundit and sage. This fact has very decisively left
an imprint on almost everything written afterwards.

[^reinterpret-european-influence-tamil-prose-fiction]: Usually, C. J. Beschi's *Paramārtta kuruvin katai* is quoted as the first
work of modern Tamil prose-fiction. Constanzo Gioseffo Eusebio Beschi was
born in Castiglione nelle Striviere (Venezia) on Nov. 8, 1680. In 1707 he
landed in Portuguese India as a member of the Society of Jesus, armed with
the knowledge of Italian, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish,
French and Persian. Soon he acquired a working knowledge of Urdu, Telugu
and Sanskrit. Tamil, however, became his great love. Until his death at
Ambalakkadu on Febr. 4, 1747, he wrote a number of grammars, dictionaries, a
great and very excellent epic poem, and a small satire in prose mentioned
above. The English translation appeared in London, 1822: The *Adventures*
of Gooroo *Paramartan*. A tale in the Tamil language: accompanied by a
translation and vocabulary, together with an analysis of the first story. By
Benjamin Babington.
