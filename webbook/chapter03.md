# PROBLEMS OF DATING, RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE CHRONOLOGY

As a preliminary remark one fundamental difficulty should at
least be mentioned: the manuscripts on palmyra leaves can hardly
be dated earlier than the 18th Century. In the climatic conditions of
South India, the palm-leaf manuscripts perish very quickly.[^cvtamotaram]
Fortunately, photostat copies of Tamil works on cadjan leaves of the
12. Cent. A.D. were made; the manuscripts were preserved in the
much more favourable climate of Tibet. But, so far, they do not
seem to be available for study.[^historytamillit] The manuscripts which were
preserved have been copied, and the natural question arises whether
the reading one obtains from these copies is that of the age of the
copyist or that of the original, and to what extent they differ.
Textual criticism, as it is understood in the West, has not yet been
adopted by the editors of Tamil classics. Even such an erudite
scholar and editor as Dr. U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar, *clarum* et *venera-*
bile *nomen* in the history of Tamil scholarship, did not strictly
adhere to the principles of textual criticism. We know almost
nothing about the manuscript traditions of the poems and anthologies,
there are almost no specialized dictionaries, indexes and
concordances, and not a single text has been critically and fully
translated and interpreted finally, with the possible exception of the
*Paripāṭal,* edited and translated by F. Gros, at Pondichéry, 1968
(see Bibliography).

[^cvtamotaram]: One of the early Tamil editors, Ci. Vay. Tāmōtaram Piḷḷai (1832-1901),
describes, in the preface to his edition of *Kalittokai* (1887), the difficulties
of his editorial work: "Only what has escaped fire and water and religious
taboo remains; even of this, termites and the insect called Rāma's arrow
take a portion; and the third element, earth, has its share, too. . . When
you lift a palm-leaf manuscript, the edge brakes. When you untie the knot,
the leaf cracks. When you turn a leaf, it breaks in half. .
All old manuscripts
are falling apart one after the other and there is no one to make new
copies". According to M. C. Vēnkaṭacāmi (*Pattonpatām nūrṛāṇṭil tamiḻ*
*ilakkiyam* 1800-1900, Madras, 1962, pp. 110-111), "unprinted texts in
manuscripts were lost within one scholar's memory or became available only
in portions, the strings untied and the other parts lost". Palm-leaf manuscripts
are occasionally produced until this day: thus, e.g., I have in my
possession a palm-leaf Ms. of *Manmatan Katai*, "The Story of the God of
Love", dated Aug.-Sept. 1952.

Also, there seems to have been a break in the traditional study of
ancient literary works before they were rediscovered in the 19th
Century. Many verses are missing even from those works which have
come down to us. On the other hand, there was a tradition of interpolation
and this is very important for us when trying to reconstruct
the original text of such works as the *Tolkāppiyam.* We know
e.g. that a nun by name of Kantiyār is said to have included her
verses in the Jain epic *Cīvakacintāmaṇi* (Nacciṇārkkiṇiyar's
Commentary on *Cint*. 3145, Irākava Aiyaṅkār's ed. of Peruntokai
1549). Interpolations, elaborations of some episodes etc. have been
probably added to the original texts: there are e.g. critics who
maintain that the *Periyapuraṇam* and the *Kamparāmāyaṇam*
contain quite a number of interpolations. And it seems to us that the
*Tolkāppiyam*, too, contains some later additions.

Those who tried to solve the chronological questions pertaining
to ancient Tamil texts did not pay much attention to what one
may call the various stages in the life of the text. It is absolutely
imperative to distinguish between these stages, otherwise one gets
entangled in a hopeless mess resulting from the unfortunate fact of
mixing these various stages and trying to date a work in question as
one homogeneous whole.

Generally speaking, we have to distinguish the following stages in
the life of a text:

1. The creative act, that is the process of the actual composition of
a text.
2. The period of oral transmission of the text.
3. The compilation of anthologies of texts.
4. The redaction (Germ. "Redaktion"), i.e. the editing and codification
of the anthologies.
5. The stage of commenting upon the texts; the composition of
commentaries and super-commentaries.
6. The critical edition or at least the preparation of a modern
edition which is more or less in agreement with the principles of
textual criticism.




A *Tamil manuscript* on palm-*leaves*. Property of the author.




1. The creative act. Several authors, lastly K. Kailasapathy
*(Tamil* Heroic *Poetry*, 1968) have conclusively shown, that the
earliest Tamil poetry was composed in agreement with the conventions of an oral bardic tradition, and that, obviously, a great
body of oral bardic literature preceded and was incorporated into the
earliest corpus of Tamil literature. Though writing as such was
known in the Tamil land during or immediately after the reign of
Aśoka, and the Tamil-Brāhmi script was fully adapted to the
language probably sometime in the 2nd Cent. B.C., it is highly
probable that for a long time writing was used only for inscriptional
purposes and, later, for grants, royal papers, letters written in
royal chancelleries; only much later for literature as such. The
creative act must have been purely oral; the early poems show
unmistakable features of oral poetry, of oral composition, destined
for audience appreciation and not visual “consumption" of literature.

2. Thus the period of oral transmission was an unusually long
one. As a random example we may give poems numbers 4 and 143,
144 and 145 of the *Puṟam* collection, ascribed to the well-known
poet Paraṇar, who composed these songs probably sometime in the
middle of the 2nd Cent. A.D. Perhaps as many as six centuries went
by until a certain Peruntēvaṇār of 8th Cent. A.D. compiled a
number of bardic poems into one single anthology of four hundred
of them, and provided this anthology with an invocatory stanza;
this anthology goes since then by the name of *Paṟanāṉūṟu* or *Puṟam*.

3. The same man was very probably responsible for the anthologization
of a great number of other early bardic poems *(Akanānūru,*
*Ainkuṟunūṟu*, *Kuṟuntokai* and *Naṟṟiṇai*). We may say that the
majority of the earliest texts were compiled into anthologies some
time in the middle of the 8th Cent. if not later (some authors date
Peruntēvaṇār into the 9th Cent.).

4. The next stage--that of the final redaction and codification of
the various anthologies into greater corpora—is even later. The
earliest Tamil poetry was compiled into two great anthologies, the
*Eṭṭuttokai,* “Eight collections", and the *Pattuppāṭṭu*, “Ten Lays”,
but the *names themselves* occur for the first time only in Pērāciriyar's
commentary to Tolk. *Poruḷ*. 362 and 392 where he speaks about
*pāṭṭu* and *tokai,* that is in the 13th-14th Cent. A.D.; and by Mayilainātar,
a commentator of the grammar *Naṇnūl* (also in the 13.-14.
Cent.); he speaks about *eṇperuttokai* and *pattuppāṭṭu* (s. v. 387:
*aimperuṅkāppiyam*, *eṇperuttokai*, *pattuppāṭṭu*, patineṇkilkkaṇakku).
Before that, though the individual anthologies are mentioned and
cited by various commentators, the two great anthologies of
*Eṭṭuttokai* and *Pattuppāṭṭu* never figure in these commentaries: e.g.
in the commentary on *Iṟaiyaṉār Akapporuḷ* by Nakkīrar (8th
Cent. A.D.) or in Iḷampūraṇar the earliest commentator on *Tolk*., in
the 12th Cent. Thus it seems that the final codification of the texts
into the two great anthologies has not been made before 13.-14.
Cent. A.D.

5. The ancient literature, once it was anthologized, and especially
after its final codification, was submitted to extensive comments,
annotations and interpretations by medieval scholiasts; this period
of great commentaries starts probably in the 8th Cent. A.D. with
Nakkīrar's commentary on Iṟaiyaṉār's Akapporuḷ and Iḷampūraṇar's
commentary on *Tolkāppiyam*, and ends with Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar's
commentaries of the 14th Century. Later, a great number
of miscellaneous lesser commentaries were written, and those of
them that are available form a literature in themselves. Taking as
an instance, again, the stanzas in Puṟam, an ancient anonymous
commentary is available up to stanza No. 266 of this collection;
apart from that, there exists a modern super-commentary by Auvai
S. Doraiswami Pillai to the whole anthology.

6. Finally, beginning with late 19th Cent., the early poetry was
being published in many editions of different kind and quality.
Thus e.g. the anthology *Paṟanāṉūṟu* was published in 1894 by
the great U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar in what is an approximation to
a critical edition.

Another problem which is involved in the general question of
dating and chronology of the early works is the fact that a number
of literary personalities occur under one and the same name, and
very many writers and editors have committed the mistake of
regarding persons bearing identical name as identical people. Thus
we have e.g. Auvaiyār who comes in the pre-Pallavan age of so-called
*Caṅkam* literature; another Auvaiyār appears as a contemporary of
Cuntarar in the Pallava age; and a third Auvaiyār, the author of the
popular didactic works, appears in the later Chola age as a contemporary
of Oṭṭakkūttar. There was also the habit of later writers
assuming the names of great poets of a previous age: this may be
the case of Kapilar. There are at least three poets going by this
name: one who is sometimes called Tol-Kapilar or the "Old Kapilar"
(cf. colophon to Akam 282 etc.), then Kapilar the Great-"the
prince" of the so called *Caṅkam* poets, and finally the late Kapilar,
the author of the late-medieval *Kapilarakaval,* an antibrahminic
outcry.



We have at least two Nakkīrars: the older Nakkīrar might have
lived round about 250 A.D. and was the author of some very fine
poems in the anthologies. A later Nakkīrar is the author of *Tirumu-*
*rukārruppaṭai*; and probably the same man composed the commentary
to *Iṟaiyaṉār Akapporuḷ* in the 8th Cent. A.D.[^nakkirars] Certain works
elaborated by a series of scholars in a particular school of thought
were sometimes named after their original teacher and *guru:* such
may be the case of *Tolkāppiyam*, or rather its third portion, which
is probably much later than the basic parts of the first two portions
but goes, too, under the name of Tolkāppiyar.

Finally, there is the problem of the language of the earliest
literature: the uniformity of the language is part of the whole
picture of the uniformity and homogeneity of the poetry itself; the
linguistic matter of the early bardic poetry is a highly standardized,
conventionalized language making use of stereotype formulae; it is
a normalized, highly polished language of a high literary style. On
the other hand, one should always bear in mind that this literature
is a corpus of poems arranged, as pointed above, much later into
collections and hyper-collections and that, consequently, these
anthologies contain material of very different age and antiquity,
ranging probably from the 2nd-1st Cent. B.C. to the 3rd or 4th
Cent. A.D. The fact that not much linguistic development is
detectable within the bulk of the earliest poems is due to the
conventionalized, in some ways petrified, "frozen”, linguistic
norms.

One extreme case was to date these texts between the 9th-10th
and the 13th Cent. A.D. These attempts are no more seriously
considered nowadays, though in the earlier editions of the *Encyclo-*
*paedia Britannica* or in the writings of the French scholar Julien
Vinson this was the accepted dating. However, neither Vinson nor

[^nakkirars]: The identity of these two Nakkīrars is still a disputed question. To be
precise, there are actually more Nakkīrars than two in Tamil writing. Many
bards bore the name of Kirar (e.g. Kuṭṭuvaṉ Kīraṇār, Maturai Nakkīrar,
Viļankīraṇār). Of the better known Nakkīrars, there may be three or four:
1. Nakkīrar the bard, the author of the lyrical pieces in the *tokais*. 2. He is
probably identical with Nakkīrar, the author of the beautiful lay “The
Long Good Northern Wind". A.D. 215 (?). 3. Another Nakkīrar, the author
of *Tirumurukāṟṟuppaṭai*. Cca 700-800 A.D. 4. He may or may not be identical
with Nakkīrar the author of the commentary of Iṟaiyaṉār's *Kaḷaviyal*
(that is with Maturaik Kaṇakkāyaṉār Makan Nakkīrar). Cca 700-800 A.D.
5. One or more Nakkīrars, author(s) of some of the poems which are included
in the 11th *Tirumuṟai* (Saiva Canon).



Rost, the author of the pertinent lines in the *Encyclopaedia Britanni-*
*ca,* had access to the earliest texts; they were not aware of their
existence (Vinson knew only one of the anthologies, *Kalittokai,*
which is anyhow a later collection, Caldwell and Rost considered
the *Tirukkuṟaḷ* to be the earliest Tamil literary work). This dating
of the beginnings of Tamil literature can be thus dismissed without
any further ado.

Swamikannu Pillai's is a much more serious attempt: he dates the
bulk of the earliest poetry into the 7th-8th Cent. A.D. (his calculations
are based on astronomical data and result in the date 756 A.D.
for the epic poem *Cilappatikāram*, and 634 A.D. for *paripāṭal,* one
of the Eight Anthologies). He gives a few additional reasons; they
need not be discussed in detail, since this dating in general goes
against the evidence of the history of South India, against the
internal linguistic evidence, and against some other considerations,
e.g. of the prevalent religious situation (a period of absolute tolerance
for Buddhism and Jainism during and immediately after the
earliest literary period as opposed to the intolerance typical for the
age of the Pallavas, characteristic for the beginnings of militant
Hinduism in the South).

The most plausible date for the bulk of early Tamil literature is
the 2nd Cent. A.D. This date, suggested by G. K. Sesha Iyer on the
astronomical computation of the great fire of Madurai in 171 A.D.,
was taken up by K. A. Nilakanta Sastri and S. Vaiyapuri Pillai who,
I think, were the first to prove more or less conclusively, especially in
*A Comprehensive History* of *India,* Vol. II, 1957, that the bulk of
the earliest Tamil lyrical poetry was composed between 100-250
A.D.

Let us now examine in detail the external and internal evidence
for this date, as presented by K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, and as supported
by the contemporary and rather conclusive testimony provided
by the historical analysis of the early Tamil Brahmi inscriptions and
some other material.

The earliest Tamil literature extant has been preserved in two
great super-anthologies, the *Eṭṭuttokai* and the *Pattuppāṭṭu*. Chart 3
gives the titles of the various eight anthologies of the great collection,
and the names of the ten lays contained in the second great anthology,
in their traditional order.

It has been noted, and nowadays only the most stubborn of the
traditional pandits would not admit this fact, that out of the eight


collections of the first great anthology, two, namely the *paripāṭal*
and the *Kalittokai* are, in their entirety, later than the rest. As far as
the second great anthology is concerned, at least one poem is undoubtedly
of later origin than the rest, namely the *Tirumurukärrup-*
*paṭai*. Thus we are left with six anthologies of *Eṭṭuttokai* and with
nine *pāṭṭus* or lays of *Pattuppāṭṭu.*

*Eṭṭuttokai* "Eight Collections"
CHART 3
1. *Naṟṟiṇai* "(The anthology of poems about) the good *tiṇais"*
2. *Kuṟuntokai* "The anthology of short (poems)"
3. *Ainkuṟunūṟu* "The five hundred short (poems)"
4. Patiṟṟuppattu "The ten tens"
5. *paripāṭal* "(The composition in the) *paripāțal* metre"
6. *Kalittokai* "The anthology in the *kali* metre"
7. *Akanāṉūṟu* or *Netuntokai* "The four hundred (stanzas) about *akam*" or
"The anthology of long (poems)"
8. *Paṟanāṉūṟu* "The four hundred (stanzas) about *puṟam"*
*Pattuppāṭṭu* "Ten Lays”
1. *Tirumurukāṟṟuppaṭai* "The guide to Lord Muruku"
2. *Porunarāṟṟuppaṭai* "The guide for the war-bards"
3. *Ciṟupāṇāṟṟuppaṭai* "The guide for the bards with the small lute"
4. Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai "The guide for the bards with the large lute"
5. *Mullaippāṭṭu* "The song about the forest (life)"
6. *Maturaikkāňci* "The reflection on Maturai"
7. *Netunalvāṭai* "The good long northern wind"
8. *Kuṟiňcippāṭṭu* "The song about the hills"
9. Paṭṭiṉappalai "(The poem about) separation (and about) the city"
10. *Malaipaṭukaṭām* "(The poem of the sound) *kaṭām* pertaining to the
mountains"
It seems to me reasonable to assume that the earliest poetry began
first to be fixed in writing, and later anthologized, as soon as it
ceased to be part of a living tradition, in other words, as soon as
it ceased to be a living, orally transmitted poetry for audience
appreciation. With the cessation of a living bardic tradition,
probably sometime in the so-called dark age of the Kalabhras,
round about the middle of the 1st millennium, this earliest poetry
ceased to be created, sung, and orally transmitted; at this time or
slightly later, it presumably became a kind of "frozen", classical
literature, which had definitely run out as a living literature during
the first great wave of devotional poetry under the Pallavas. It
gradually became a matter of interest only for the scholar, for the
savant, for the erudite *litterateur*; it also became progressively more
unintelligible, for the language changed as well as the conventions


and subject-matter of poetry. That was probably the period when,
for the first time, a need was felt for commentaries and theoretical
treatises dealing with this classical heritage. This heritage was
ultimately preserved only and exclusively by the learned poets (not
by the popular poets), and by the scholiasts and commentators.
Even the scholiast and the commentator ceased to be interested
during the late medieval times, until in fact this early poetry faded
into oblivion and had to be rediscovered in almost modern times.
The "rediscovery" of ancient Tamil literature occurred in the
transition period of the later 19th Cent. when-to employ the happy
phrase of A. K. Ramanujan-"both paper and palm leaf were used'.
The two men most responsible for making possible this very
transition were Damodaram Pillai (1832-1901) and U. V. Swaminatha
Aiyar (1855-1942).

It has just been stressed that the anthologization is much later
than the actual creation of the poetry, and that the final codification
is very probably, again, much later than the anthologization. The
name Peruntēvaṇār was mentioned before. Five of the six earlier
collections of the *Eṭṭuttokai* hyper-anthology are introduced by
*Peruntēvanār's* invocatory verses: *Akanāṉūṟu*, *Ainkuṟunūṟu, Ku-*
*runtokai*, *Naṟṟiṇai*, and *Paṟanāṉūṟu*. A certain *Peruntēvaṇār* is
quoted as the author of a Tamil version of the *Mahabharata* (this
*campu* work has unfortunately reached us only as a fragment). A few
verses of this *Pāratam* are quoted in the commentaries.¹ It may
probably be dated into the middle of the 8th Cent. These two
persons are probably identical, since the Perutēvaṇār who wrote
these introductory verses to the ancient anthologies is referred to
persistently as *pāratam* pāṭiya *peruntēvaṇār,* “The Peruntēvaṇār
who the Bhārata". Whether this man was also the compiler of
sang
the anthologies is a problem. It is only a hypothesis, though a
plausible one. One thing is clear: the anthologization of the poems
seems to be much later than their actual composition and corroborative
evidence may be drawn from the fact that even within the
collections themselves poems of rather different antiquity may be
found: thus, e.g., the majority of the poems collected in the *Kurun-*
*tokai* anthology belongs probably to the Ist Cent. B.C.-2nd Cent.
1 This work seems to have been composed in the *veṇpā* metre interspersed
with prose. Cf. Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar's comm. on Tolk. *Purattinaiyiyal* 17.21,
and the commentaries to *Viracöliyam*, Porutpat 15 and *Alankārappat.* 12,

A page from the 1962 edition of *Kuṟuntokai* with U.V. Swaminatha
Aiyar's commentary. Property of the author.





A.D.; but the same anthology contains a poem, *Kur*. 2, ascribed to
Iṟaiyaṉār, the author of Akapporuḷ, probably of the 5th-6th
Cent. A.D.

It has already been stressed, too, that the final codification of the
earliest extant poetry must have been later than the compilation of
various anthologies. Of crucial importance for this hypothesis is the
silence maintained by the famous commentary by Nakkīrar on
Iṟaiyaṉār's *Akapporuḷ;* Nakkīrar speaks in detail about the early
poetry, he gives a full account of the legend of the *Caṅkam* (Academy),
but he never mentions the great anthologies. Though an
*argumentum ex silentio,* it is rather persuasive.

The work itself is very interesting. Composed some time in the
5th-6th Cent. A.D., it is probably the most ancient of the theoretical
works on the *akam* and *puṟam* genres (probably older than the
*Poruḷatikāram* of the *Tolkāppiyam*). The work has been attributed
(by a credulous generation) to the God Siva himself because the
name of its author, Iṟaiyaṉār, can be interpreted as God or Śiva.
There is also a poem, *Kur*. 2, which is attributed to Iṟaiyaṉār.
Another name of the treatise is *Iṟaiyaṉār Kaḷaviyal*. It deals
exclusively with the *akam* genre-a lucid, continuous text; though
much of it does not require a commentary, it obtained one, and this
commentary is ascribed to one Nakkīrar who is definitely different
from the poet Nakkīrar of the early anthologies, but also different
from the author of *Neṭunalvāṭai,* one of the "Ten Lays". However,
he may be identical with the poet who composed *Tirumurukāṛṛup-*
*patai,* a very late poem of the "guide" genre. The date of this
commentary is a matter of dispute. If the two Nakkīrar's are
identical then the date could be anything between the 6th-7th and
8th Cent. A.D. If they were not identical, the commentary could be
as late as the 10th-12th Cent. But I would be inclined-for a number
of reasons which I cannot go into here¹-to regard the poet and
1 The commentary on *Iṟaiyaṉār* Akapporuḷ uses the similes taken from
the description of pre-marital love as found in the *Perunkatai,* cf. *Iṟaiyaṉār*
Akapp. *sūtra* 2 (ed. 1939), p. 38: *Perunkatai* I, xxxii, 17 and 18. *Perun-*
*katai* is earlier than the 10th Cent., but certainly not earlier than cca 700
A.D. Durvinita's *Byhatkathā,* very likely the model of *Perunkatai*, was
composed probably in the 1st half of the 7th Cent. For the upper limit
cf. the fact that Pāṇṭikkōvai (by an unknown author) written probably
in the 8th Cent. (since it is crammed with references to the victories of the
Pandya kings of the 7th and 8th centuries), is a collection (*kōvai*) of poems
out of which about 250 have been preserved, and the major portion of these
are taken from the commentary on *Iṟaiyaṉār Kaḷaviyal* (*Akapporu!).*
the commentator as one and the same man, and set the date of the
commentary at about 750 A.D. A tradition maintains that the
commentary was composed by the poet Nakkīrar and was transmitted
orally for eight generations until it was written down by a
Nilakantan of Muciṟi.

This tradition is not at all absurd. Lately we have come to regard
such and similar traditions with more credulity than in the age of
pure empirical positivism. It was after all found out that many
persistent indigenous traditions (e.g. the one incorporating the
famous Gajabāhu synchronism) may be on the whole trusted. While
the commentary itself was very probably composed by a Nakkīrar
of the 8th Cent., it again very probably was transmitted orally
until it was fixed as a written text by Nilakaṇṭan of Muciṟi. 1 This
commentary of Nakkīrar is actually one of the first specimen of
Tamil prose, not bits of unmeasured verse as in *Cilappatikāram,* but
pages and pages of genuine prose (ornate, poetic, alliterative,
metaphorical, and full of similes).

I am dealing with this work and its commentary at this length
because it will again and again be mentioned (especially while
Nakkīrar's commentary, though regarded by many as inferior to the text
itself, has descriptive passages of literary beauty, with alliterations and
assonances, and they can even be metrically scanned (see chapter 16 of this
book; cf. also T. P. Meenakshisundaran, *HTL* 173).

1 This can be inferred e.g. *ab intra* from the manner in which the commentary
itself proceeds, cf. utterances like urai *naṭantu varāniņṛamai* nōkki, or
*ini urai națantavāru collutum*, or *innanam varukinṛatu urai.* The commentary
is said to "proceed", "to come down" to us, obviously through oral tradition.
That the commentary very probably contains later interpolations was
recognized already in 1938 by R. Narayanan of Jaffna who describes it as a
"commentary which has come down to us with innumerable alterations".
These interpolations are probably responsible for S. Vaiyapuri Pillai's
opinion expressed in *Käviyakālam* pp. 215-216 where he tries to show that
the commentary in its present *form* is clearly indebted to *Cīvakacintāmaṇi*
(10th Cent.). On the other hand, there is a persistent and early tradition that
Nakkīrar was the author of the commentary, cf. Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar's comm.
on *Tolk*. *Poruḷ.* p. 808, and *Poruḷ. Marapu* 814. This commentary uses once
the term *elutinān* “he wrote (down)", cf. ivvurai *ceytār yārōvenravuli* ma*turaik
kaṇakkāyaṉār makaṇār nakkīrarena urai yelutinān* (instead of the
prevalent *urai kaṇṭavan*). V. S. C. Pillai is probably right when he says that
Nakkīrar composed the main outlines of his commentary, which was then
orally transmitted probably for about 200-300 years, until sometime in the
10th Cent. it was written down by Nilakaṇṭar who also gave an introduction
and supplied the commentary with additional and "modern" quotations.
The date of the commentary was first set as 8th Cent. A.D. by V. Kanakasabhai
Pillai in *The Tamils* 1800 *Years Ago* (1904). Cf. also Chapter 16 of
this book.

discussing the legend of the *Caṅkam*, and because it very probably
is the first theoretical treatise on the poetic conventions of ancient
Tamil). What one has especially to bear in mind is the distinction in
date between the text itself and its commentary. Let me repeat: the
text was composed probably sometime between the 4th and 6th
Cent. A.D. The commentary-round about 750 A.D.

It has also been said that the earliest commentator on the *Tolka-*
ppiyam, Iḷampūraṇar, who was given the distinguished title
*uraiyāciriyar*, i. e. *The Commentator* (and he deserves this title), and
who probably belonged to the 12th. Cent., does not mention the
anthologies. In the 13th-14th Cent., however, three commentators,
Mayilainātar, Pērāciriyar, and Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar, mention by name
the two great anthologies; hence we may assume that the final
codification of the poems occurred sometime between the 12th and
13th Centuries.

Now we finally come to the problem of the external and internal
evidence for the dating of the earliest literature of the Tamils.
Let us first consider the purely historical correlations. According
to G. Jouveau-Dubreuil *(The Pallavas*, 1917, p. 10), the beginnings
of the Pallava dynasty of Kāňci is to be dated sometime in the
first half of the 3rd Cent. A.D. In the 6th and 7th Cent. A.D. the
Pallavas were one of the most powerful and important South Indian
dynasties. The first important Tamil Pallava inscription may be
dated roughly in 550 A.D. In the earliest Tamil poetry, there is not
a single allusion to the Pallavas, they are not mentioned at all,
though much of this poetry, especially in the Patiṟṟuppattu and
*Puṟam* collections, is of quasi-historical nature and mentions a
number of Indian, particularly Tamil dynasties, dynastic names,
events etc. True, this is an *argumentum* ex *silentio*, yet one can
hardly assume that such a powerful dynasty and state as that of the
Pallavas would not have been mentioned at all in a corpus of more
than 2000 poems! We may therefore safely assume that this earliest
strata of literature is pre-Pallava, that is pre-3rd Cent. A.D. Now
this conclusion fits well with other lines of evidence derived from
other data on South Indian history. What are these other lines of
evidence?
1. First of all, there are the data of Graeco-Roman authors. The
Greek and Roman trade is well attested by the early Tamil texts

themselves: the poems speak of Yavanas ¹ and their ships, of their
gold coins and Yavana wine etc., and these poems speak about the
Western merchants and their trade with the South as a well-known,
widely popular and contemporary fact; allusions to this foreign
Western-oriented trade are of such nature that we must assume
this Roman and Western trade to have been a simple fact of daily
life of those who listened to these early poems. It was shown
conclusively that the Greek and Roman trade could not have
continued in any considerable extent after the 2nd-3rd Century.2
1 There are about ten references to the Yavanas in the *Caṅkam* texts:
*Mullaip.* 61, 66, *Perumpāṇ*. 316, *Patiṟṟup*. II, *Akam* 57, 149, *Neṭuṉal*. 31-5,
101-2, *Puṟam* 56 and 353. The Yavaṇas served as body-guards to kings
*(Mullaip*. 66) and as palace-guards during the night (ib. 61). They were a
drinking, freely-moving people, decorating themselves and walking along the
city-streets during nights (*Nețunal*. 31-5). They were merchants, too; they
brought lamps of fine workmanship, swan-shaped and woman-shaped
(*Netunal*. 101-2, Perumpāṇ. 316-19); they came with gold and wine in their
ships and returned with pepper *(Akam* 149, Puṟ. 56, 343), and one of the
ports they most frequently visited was Muciṟi (*Akam* 57, 149, Puṟ. 343).

Tamil India as described in the so-called *Caṅkam* poetry was quite wellknown
to such Western authors as Pliny the Elder (75 A.D.), Ptolemy (130
A.D.), and above all to the anonymous, charming author of the *Periplus*
*Maris Erythraei* (cf. W. H. Schoff, The *Periplus* of the *Erythraean Sea,* New
York, 1912, cf. its new dating in ca. 240 A.D. by J. Pirenne in *J.A.* 1961,
also K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, *Foreign Notices* of South *India,* Madras, 1939).
The excavations in Virapatnam-Arikamedu near Pondicherry point to an old
Roman settlement, proving that the Yavaṇa settlements referred to in the
very early anthology *Patiṟṟuppattu* (*Patikam* 2) are not figments of imagination.
Roman imperial coins of gold and silver were imported in considerable
quantities and circulated freely in the country; there were probably small
copper coins bearing Roman devices and legends produced locally. In the
Greek and Latin sources we have scores of Tamil and South Indian names
both local and dynastic, which again and again occur in the earliest poetry
of the Tamils (e.g. *Tyndis*-Tonti, Kolchoi*-Korkai, Muziris-Muciri*, *Modoura-*


2. This cumulative evidence of the early Tamil texts themselves,
of the Greek and Roman authors, and of archeological data are
fully supported by the internal evidence present in the texts themselves:
here I have in mind not the historical, but linguistic and
philological evidence, derived from the state of development of the
Tamil language, and from the considerations about the prosody of
early poetry. This linguistic evidence tells us quite convincingly,
first, that there are problems of relative chronology involved with
respect to the age of the various texts themselves, and, second, that
as a whole, the earliest poetry must be quite obviously much older
than the first beginnings of the devotional *bhakti* literature of the
7th Cent. The language of the early poetry shows many decisively
older forms; to give a few diagnostic examples: the OTa. *yāṇ* “I”
occurs in Appar's songs (eg. *Patikam* 305. 1-10) as *nān,* undoubtedly
a later form; OTa i “this” gives way to Middle and Modern Ta. *inta*
in Campantar (Pat. 4. 11); OTa. has no double plural marker,
whereas *Tēvāram,* the anthology of *bhakti* hymns, abounds in it (eg.
Campantar, *Pat.* 2; 9, 10); the Old and LTa. *aintu* "five" appears
in Campantar 237. 4, as *añcu*; the present morph—*kinṛ*—which, in
the OTa. texts, is very sporadic (a few instances), is rather frequent
in Campantar, *Pat*. 2, 3-4, *Pat*. 235, 1, etc.

In short, the language of the *Tēvāram* devotional hymns presents
an entirely new and later stage of development in its morphology
and lexis; and the prosody, too, is very different and shows much
more influence of the Sanskrit *mātrā*-type of metrics. All this shows
beyond doubt that the language of the early poetry must be at least
a few centuries older than the language of the Saiva and Vaiṣṇava
hymns, the first of which were composed in the 6th-7th Cent.
3. We shall discuss the relative chronology of the various texts
later. Now we have to ask a very basic question: is there any
positive, concrete *datum* which would serve as a point of departure
for an *absolute* chronology of the earliest Tamil texts? I believe that
there is such a date, though it is still hypothetical. This hypothesis,
however, which has been strongly supported by two other kinds of
data, by evidence derived from the earliest Brāhmī inscriptions,
and by a bilingual coin, seems to me to be, to date, a rather firm
sheet-anchor for the chronology of early Tamil India. In any
*Maturai*, *Khaberis Emporion*-*Kävirippattinam*, etc. etc.), cf. F. B. J.
Kuiper, "Two Problems of Old Tamil Phonology"*, IIJ* (1958), pp. 219-221.


case, it is not quite true what H. W. Schomerus wrote a few decades
ago in his account of Tamil literature, namely, that the beginnings
of Tamil literature are enshrouded in complete darkness.
("die *Anfänge* der *Tamil*-*Literatur* liegen *völlig im Dunkeln"*).
In the well-known Tamil epic poem, The *Lay* of *the Anklet,* we
may read, in the 30th Canto, 160, the following line: *kaṭalcul*
*ilankaik kayavāku vēntan.* The whole passage reads: "The monarch
of the world circumambulated the shrine thrice and stood proferring
his respects. In front of him the Arya kings released from prison,
kings removed from the central jail, the Kongu ruler of the Kudagu,
the king of Malva and *Kayavāku,* the king of the *sea-*girt *Ceylon,*
prayed reverently to the deity thus ..." (Dikshitar's transl., p.
343). According to Cilappatikāram, Gajabāhu (the First) of Ceylon
was contemporary with the hero of the 3rd Canto of the epical poem,
the Chera king Cenkuṭṭuvan. Hence this great *Ceral* monarch who
according to Patiṟṟuppattu V ruled for 55 years, may be roughly
assigned to 170-225 A.D. (S. Vaiyapuri Pillai, *HTLL,* p. 22).2
1
This computation has been known as the *Gajabāhu Synchronism*
and it has become a sheet-anchor of early Tamil history, and our
basic point of departure for dating the earliest Tamil literature.
Though it rests on slender foundations, it is obvious from the
plentiful corroborative evidence "derived from the general possibilities
of history in Northern and Southern India" (K.A. Nila1
For the first time, the "Gajabāhu synchronism" was made the centre of
attention by V. Kanakasabhai Pillai, The *Tamils* 1800 *Years* Ago (1904),
p. 7; he however dates Gajabāhu I in 113-125 A.D., which was proved
incorrect.

2 In Ceylonese history, there were two kings by name of Gajabāhu: since
the second ruled as late as in the 12th Cent., it must be the first who is meant
here. Gajabāhu I is mentioned in *Mahāvaṃso* XXXV, pp. 253-5 as follows:
"After Vankanasikatissa's death, his son Gajabāhukagāmani reigned
twenty-two years". Dr. Wilhelm Geiger, in his translation of the *Mahāvaṃso*
(Pali Text Society, 1912) gives a list of Ceylonese kings, in which Gajabāhu
I appears as the island's 46th ruler, ruling between 171-193 A.D. *Mahāvaṃso*
is based on genuine tradition and may well be accepted as history except for
its opening chapters. According to most scholars, Gajabāhu I ruled either
between 171-193 or 174-195 A.D. It was suggested (P. T. S. Iyengar, *History*
*of the Tamils*, pp. 335-7) that there is an alternative reading for the word
*Kayavāku*, viz. *Kāval.* But according to V. R. Dikshitar, the illustrious
editor of the epical poem, Dr U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar, after carefully
comparing 11 manuscripts of the text and 14 commentaries, accepts the
reading *Kayavāku―*i.e. Gajabāhu-as the only correct one, though he gives
the v.l. *kāval ventan* on p. 585, ed. 1950. For Gajabāhu I, cf. Epigraphia
*Zeylanica,* III, No. 1, p. 9.



kanta Sastri) that the epic poem preserves elements of a correct
historical tradition and that Cenkuṭṭuvan the *Cēral* and Gajabāhu I
of Ceylon were contemporaries, both living round 180 A.D. The
opinion that the Gajabāhu synchronism is an expression of a genuine
historical tradition is accepted by most scholars today; apart from
K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, by Seshagiri Sastri, Kanakasabhai Pillai,
Krishnaswami Aiyengar, K. Kailasapathy etc. (cf. Vaiyapuri
Pillai, *HTLL*, p. 22: "We may be reasonably certain that the
chronological conclusion reached above is historically sound").
4. The procedure as to how to arrive, from the Gajabāhu synchronism,
at an absolute dating of the bulk of so-called *Caṅkam* poetry,
is as follows: The traditions, recorded in the colophons and epilogues
of the poems of *Patiṟṟuppattu* (“The Ten Tens"'
-a bardic collection
singing about the *Cēral* kings), reflect no doubt quite reliably the
history of the Cheras. 1 A careful study of the synchronism between
the kings, chieftains and the poets suggested by the notes at the
end of the poems (assigning to each generation about 25 years)
indicates that the main body of early Tamil literature reflects events
within a period of four or five continuous generations, a period of
120-150 years. Though the details remain to be worked out and
there may be quite a number of points which need further discussion
and clarification, the labours of R. Sewell and of S. K. Iyengar,
R. Dikshitar, and above all, of K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, have brought
as their results the rough outline of Chera and Chola kings between
approximately 130 A.D.-240 A.D. The majority of the so-called
*Caṅkam* poetry, or early Tamil bardic literature, belongs thus to
100-250 A.D. This does not mean, though, that the corpora do not
contain material which may be much older (actually, some poems
are as old as the 1st Cent. B.C.) as well as much younger (some
bardic poems may be as late as the 4th-6th Cent. A.D.).
5. The epic poem *Cilappatikāram* provides yet another clue: In
Canto XXVI, Il. 149 and 163 we read about *nurruvar kannar*. This
name was identified with the dynastic name *Śātakarṇi*, *Šātakaṇi,*
the *Šātavāhanas* or *Andhras*. This powerful dynasty which followed
the Mauryan rule in the Deccan, lasted for four and a half centuries

from about 230 B.C. By the beginning of the 3rd Cent., their empire
had virtually ceased to exist. In the private collection of Dr. N. P.
Dikanara Rao, Hyderabad, is found a silver coin with a short
bilingual inscription in Prakrit and Tamil. The Prakrit text reads (?)
*vasiți putasa* siri *satakanisa raano*. The script is Brāhmī. The meaning
is "(The coin) of the king Siri Satakaṇi (Śrī Śātakarṇi) Vasiṭiputa
(Vasiṣṭhiputrasya)". The Tamil text, also in Brāhmī, reads *vaciṭṭi-*
*makanku* tiru *catakaṇiku aracanku.* 1 This king established himself
on the *Śātavāhana* throne perhaps in 168 or 170 A.D. 2 This short
bilingual is only a slight corroboration of our dating, but it *is* a kind
of evidence: first, it shows the use of Brähmi for epigraphic Tamil in
the 2nd Cent. A.D.; second, it shows the use of Tamil as an important
language side by side with Prakrit -probably a *lingua-*
*franca* of the South of that time (the *Śātakarṇis* were an *Andhra,*
not a Tamil *kula)*; third, it is a corroboration for the identification
of the name *nurruvarkanṇar* of the Cilappatikāram with the *kula-*
name *Satakarni-Šātavāhanas*; and, finally, the palaeography and
the grammar of this short inscription is identical with the other
Brāhmī Tamil inscriptions and with a rule of the *Tolkāppiyam*
(about the possessive dative); and so even this short bilingua on a
*Śātavāhana* coin helps in the dating of the earliest Tamil texts.
6. The most important corroborative evidence which shows the
reliability of the Gajabāhu synchronism on the one hand and of the
colophons in the *Patiṟṟuppattu* collection on the other hand is found
in the results of the splendid work performed by Iravatham Mahadevan
and published in his "Corpus of the Tamil-Brāhmi Inscriptions",
*Seminar* on Inscriptions, Madras, 1966, pp. 56-73, and in his

and especially of I. Mahadevan, we now know of the existence of
76 rock-inscriptions in the Tamil-Brāhmi script from 21 sites in the
Tamil country. While these inscriptions are very short and the
reading of some of them is still not quite clear, it is true that the
importance of these texts for the study of early Tamil language,
literature and history is out of proportion to their volume. Especially
I. Mahadevan's discovery of the rock inscriptions of the *Cēral*
*Irumpoṟai* dynasty at Pukalūr and of the Pāṇḍyas at Mangulam
enables us to identify some of the kings and chieftains with the
heroes of *Caṅkam* poems. This is of enormous importance for the
dating of literary texts.

a) Thus Kō Ātan Cellirumporai of the Pukalur Inscription
(dated ca. 200 A.D.) can be identified with Celvakkaṭunkō Vāliyātan,
the hero of the VII. decade of *Patiṟṟuppattu.*

b) There are further identifications of Chera feudatories whose
names occur in these epigraphs, with the heroes of poems from
*Patiṟṟuppattu, Akam 77*, 143, *Puṟam* 168-172 etc. Thus the Pukalūr
Tamil-Brāhmi Inscription (dated with the help of the Arikamedu
*graffiti*) became another sheet-anchor of the early Tamil chronology.
c) The two rock inscriptions of Neṭuňceḻiyaṉ found at Mangulam
near Madurai are the earliest known historical records in Tamilnad.
The archaic palaeography and the linguistic features of these
inscriptions indicate an earlier date than the Arikamedu *graffiti.*
They can be dated towards the close of the 2nd Cent. B.C. Neṭuňceḻiyaṉ
was probably the ruling king of the day (who should not be
identified with his namesake of Cilappatikāram and other so-called
*Caṅkam* works!). The end of the 2nd Cent. B.C. seems to be the
period as we shall see later-when the original text of the *Tolkāppi-*
*yam* which I propose to call the *Ur-Tolkāppiyam* was composed.
Thus, the analysis of these earliest Tamil epigraphic records
establishes a correlation between earliest inscriptional texts and
earliest literary texts: a number of poems of the earliest anthologies
appear in a new light, and happen to be dateable; thus correlation

has been established with *Akam 77,* 143, *Puṟam* 158 and 168, 169,
387*, Akam* 115 and 253. Taking into consideration the cumulative
evidence of the linguistic, epigraphic, archaeological, numismatic
and historical data, both internal and external, it is undoubtedly
possible to arrive at the following final conclusion: *the earliest* corpus
*of* Tamil *literature may* be *dated between* 100 *B.C. and* 250 *A.D.*
The question is which texts out of the corpus of the so-called
*Caṅkam* literature belong to this earliest body of Tamil literary
texts? Though a detailed relative chronology cannot be worked out
yet with any appreciable degree of exactness and rigour, a tentative
relative chronology of the earliest Tamil texts may be arrived at on
the basis of labours performed by S. Vaiyapuri Pillai, M. Raghava
Iyengar, K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, John R. Marr, K. Kailasapathy
and others. The results of this relative chronology may be seen in
Chart 4.

These are the most ancient texts in the Tamil language. The
earliest poems contained in these texts belong roughly to 100 B.C.250
A.D. The upper limit for these anthologies is the 5th-6th Cent.
A.D. Linguistically, this period is usually described as *Early Old*
Tamil. At the beginning of this period, we have the *Urtext* of the
*Tolkāppiyam*. At the end of this period, we have the earliest
poetics of Tamil, the *Akapporuḷ* of Iṟaiyaṉār.
