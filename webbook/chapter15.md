# ARUNAKIRI, THE GREAT MAGICIAN

Aruṇakiri[^name-etymology] is the essence and condensation of a type: probably
the greatest language-tamer among Tamil poets, certainly one of
the greatest formalists in Tamil literature. And that is also why
some scholars would say of him and his work: “As religion and as
poetry his verses are not much ... (they show) a revelling in the
erotic element first and then a religious reaction against it
other works are mere word-jugglery for the lover of literature".[^word-jugglery]

[^name-etymology]: The name Aruṇakiri or Aruṇakirinātar means "(The lord of) the Aruṇahill
(of the fiery hill, *or*, mountain of light)", i.e. of Aruṇācalam. The poet was
born in Tiruvaṇṇāmalai, under the Aruṇācalam mountain; much later, in
our century, the place became the site of the *āśvam* founded by Sri Ramaṇa
Mahāṛṣi.

[^word-jugglery]: C. and H. Jesudasan, op. cit. pp. 212-213.

Why this judgement? Because this wizard of language and
rhythm has indeed reached the dangerous brink between true
poetry and mere formalistic skill. Some of his lines are indeed
clever, sophisticated, expert bijoutry. But most of his poems are
brilliant jewels, glittering and glowing with emeralds, rubies,
amethysts and carbuncles, with gold and pearls.

At the same time, Aruṇakiri is the sum and substance of that
type of Tamil poets who have achieved a complete and harmonious
integration of two cultures: Sanskritic and Tamil. In this type,
there is a total penetration of the Tamil structure by the Sanskrit
structure, and the result is a happy and immensely rich blend. In
Aruṇakiri, it is an ambrosial amalgam above all in the expressionside
of his poetry, in language and prosody. Even in stanzas which
are very heavily Sanskritized,[^sanskritized-verses] the final effect is marvellous, e.g.

[^sanskritized-verses]: Considered to be a grave sin by some critics: "His poetry is heavily
packed with Sanskrit words". C. and H. Jesudasan, op. cit. p. 212.

> *ēltalampukal kāvēriyāl vilai* \
> *cola manțala mītē manōkara* \
> *rāca kempira nāṭāļum nāyaka* \
> *vayalūrā* \
>
> "O lord of the fields, \
> o prince who rules \
> above the vast and charming kingdom, \
> the Cholamandalam, fertile by Kāvēri \
> famous for its seven shrines \

Here, the ratio is about 60% of Tamil words to 40% of Sanskrit.
But in the next stanza

> *tipa mankala* cōti *namōnama* \
> *tuya ampala līlā namōnama* \
> *tēva kuňcara pākā namōnama* \
> *arultārāy* \

there is less than 30% of Tamil items and more than 70% of
Sanskrit loanwords. Observe the *cantam*, the rhythmic pattern:

<center><p>*tána tánana tánā tanánana*;</p></center>

this is maintained throughout the stanza, ending with *tánanāná*:
*arultārāy.*

Two of the four main properties of Aruṇakiri's songs are revealed
in this stanza: immensely rich vocabulary[^vocabulary] having as its source the
treasures of Tamil as well as of Sanskrit;[^source-tamil-sanskrit] and *cantam* or regular
rhythmic pattern.

[^vocabulary]: "Words, marshalled with rhymes and alliterations interspersed, break
from him in a deluge." C. and H. Jesudasan, op. *cit.* p. 212.

[^source-tamil-sanskrit]: In a sense, Aruṇakiri's god is also a happy blend of the two cultures, and
his two wives symbolize this fact: Teyvayānai, the daughter of Indra,
stands for Sanskrit, Vaḷḷi for Tamil. Murukaṉ himself has been always
considered the prince of poets, cf. Kumarakuruparar's invocation: “O
Prince Bard of *Caṅkam* literature!"

The term and notion of *cantam* needs somewhat detailed discussion.
Historically, it means an assault of Sanskritic, *mātrā*-type
and *syllabic*-based ("syllabic” in our Western sense) metrics on the
indigenous metrical system of Tamil which was not syllabic, but
*acai*-based (cf. the beginning of Chapter 5). *cantam* is a rigidly set
pattern of rhythm, based on syllabic quantity. The beginnings of
its influence in Tamil prosody are naturally connected with the
adoption of fixed melody-types (*pan*) for poetry which is identified
with (devotional) singing. Poetry as (devotional) song set to a
fixed melody evolved in Saiva and Vaiṣṇava bhakti texts, and hence
also the first poets who employed, on the Sanskritic models,
quantitative prosody of the *cantam (chandas*) type, were Campantar
and Tirumālicai Āḻvār, two early Saiva and Vaiṣṇava bhaktas.[^cantam] The
influence of *cantam* grew steadily until it reached its peak in the
poems of Aruṇakiri.[^cantam-poem-structure] This is part of the process whereby the connection
between poetry and music becomes closer and closer, more
and more intimate, until the *kīrttanai* is born-a form in which
music is as indispensable as the text itself. And Aruṇakiri's
Tiruppukaḻ, singing the 'praise of the Lord', is one of the basic
foundations of *kīrttaṉai*; only it has no refrain yet, no *pallavi* (like
*kīrttaṉai)*.

[^cantam]: The poets noted for skillful use of *cantam* were, after Tirumālicai Āḻvār
(8th Cent.) who has probably been the one most responsible for its introduction
into Tamil prosody (in his *Tiruccantaviruttam*): Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār,
Paṭṭiṉattar the Elder, Nampiyāṇṭār Nampi, Cayankoṇṭār, Oṭṭakkūttaṉ,
Villi, and, of course, Aruṇakiri.

[^cantam-poem-structure]: A poem in *cantam* has, in *addition* to other formal properties (prosodic
pattern, *toṭai*, i.e. "rhymes", alliteration, assonance etc.), a rigidly set
rhythmic pattern in terms of syllabic quantity. E.g. in Tiruppukaḻ 418:
*tirumakalulāvum | irupuyamurāri | tirumurukanāma* | *perumāļ kāņ*; the *cantam*
is *tána tána tánā'na | tána tána tánā'na* | *tána tána tánā'na* | *tána tā'nā*, i.e.
--- 00/000000/0-00000/00000.00

In thought-content and themes, Aruṇakiri is one of the peaks in
a particular line of *bhakti* poets; another poet of the same line-yet
different because deeper, because more of a thinker and mystic
than Aruṇakiri, and less of a poet, yet basically belonging to the
same type Tayumāṇavar (1706-1744), admired and loved Aruṇakiri,
and praised him more than once, e.g.

> *aiyā aruṇakiri appā unaippōla* \
> *meyyāka* ōr col *viļampinar yār* \

"O sir, Aruṇakiri, friend, who ever uttered such true words as
you?" And elsewhere he speaks about him as *maturam poliyum*
*aruṇakiri*, "Aruṇakiri, who pours forth sweetness".

Typical is also the legend of the poet's life; it is a characteristically
late bhakti legend. The hero leads a wretched life. Without his
personal merit, and so to say in the last moment, God in his
mercy intervenes, turning the scoundrel into a saint, into a *bhakta*
and into a poet. And once more the deity is localized in a particular
South Indian shrine, under the Aruṇācalam mountain.

Aruṇakiri was born in Tiruvaṇṇāmalai and spent his young years
as a rioter, good-for-nothing brawler, drunkard and unbridled
seducer of women. Everyone despaired of him. The most unhappy
of all was his sister, who was the only one that kept a place for him
in her heart, when all others turned their back on him because with
progressing years his lack of self-control and his daring increased.

The poet describes in vivid colours this stage of his life, speaking
about his *kāmukan akappaṭṭa ācai,* "the passions of a lewd man",
about his *vilaimātar kaṇivāyil kanṇalivu vaitta* putti “blind mind
guided only by the senses inflamed by harlots".

After having ruined his health[^poor-health] and reputation and having
become a real menace to society, he one day tried to commit
suicide, disgusted with life and with himself, and unable to bear
the pains of his ruined body. He threw himself into the abyss from
the northern tower of the famous Tiruvaṇṇāmalai temple to end
his wretched life.

[^poor-health]: According to one version, he suffered from a stomach (or duodenal)
ulcer; according to another version, from a venereal disease.


However he did not shatter his limbs by the terrible fall, but
landed softly in the arms of a holy man who just at that moment
appeared unexpectedly at the bottom of the gopura and who was
none else but the god Murukaṉ himself. After having thus saved
Aruṇakiri's life he expelled from his heart the threefold craving—
*mannācai ponnācai peṇṇācai*—the desire for earth, gold and women,
he touched with the point of his spear Aruṇakiri's tongue and
exclaimed: nī *pāṭuka*! Sing! Naturally, Aruṇakiri was in no mood
to sing, not to mention the fact that he did not know how or what
to sing. And so Lord Murukaṉ himself sang the first verse beginning
with the words *muttaitaru* pattittirunakai *kurupara* "O my guru
... with the lovely smile of your pearl-like teeth!"

The next moment Aruṇakiri was a new person. Even the physical
signs of his deterioration vanished from his depraved face and body,
and Aruṇakiri, young, handsome and pure, burst into streams of
beautiful songs, which amazed the crowds, led by his sister.

From that day Aruṇakiri became the most ardent devotee of
Murukaṉ, wandering from temple to temple throughout Tamilnad,
praising life and God in verses which have no like in Tamil literature.

Thus far the legend.

About the real Aruṇakiri we know very little. He himself mentions
a ruler by name of Praudhadevaraya, who probably is no else than
the noted Deva Raya II, the Vijayanagara king known as *Gajabēṭe-*
*kara* "Hunter of elephants". He was a great patron of poets and
a great builder, reigning from 1426 till 1446. On the other hand, a
Sanskrit poet, Rajendra Kavi, who lived in the 15th Cent., speaks
of a Sarvabhauma Dindima Kavi as of his father, and there is some
reason to identify this *kavi* with Aruṇakiri.

Aruṇakiri left behind a huge poetic work: 1367 stanzas of *Tirup-*
*pukaḻ,* praises of Murukaṉ, the eternally young, the handsome lover
and warrior, symbol of youth and strength, victory, of movement
and change in life and nature, the patron of poets and god of
travellers. Apart form *Tiruppukaḻ,* Aruṇakiri is the author of many
hundreds of other poems, forming several large collections (the
chief among them being *Kantaralankāram* of 102 stanzas and
*Kantaranupūti* of 51 stanzas), imbued with tremendous knowledge
of mythology and legends, and characterized by perfection of form
and sovereign command of diction and prosody.

The work of Aruṇakiri may be described as religious, lyrical
hymnody, interwoven with Saiva Siddhānta philosophic doctrines,
and fed profusedly by Aryan and indigenous mythology. At the same
time, however, his poetry has a vitality gushing from the poet's
own inner experience; the poet's all-embracing and glowing love for
all aspects of life, from the beauty of a pearl or an emerald through
flowers, birds, beasts to men-especially women-and ultimately
for God.

Several streams converge and merge in his work: the hymnic
tradition of Saiva and Vaiṣṇava *bhakti,* the reflective stream of
Śaiva Siddhānta philosophy, the ancient inheritance of bardic
poetry, both *puṟam* and *akam,* the vast resources of Aryan mythology,
the deep wells of indigenous Tamil myths and legends connected
with the cult of Murukaṉ, and, last but not least, his own
shattering life-experience.

There are basically poems of three types in Aruṇakiri's work:
lyrical poetry of personal experience with rich autobiographical
material, reflective lyrical poetry with elements of philosophy, and
straightforward hymns praising Lord Murukaṉ.

If we apply the scheme of the segments S₁₂O₁₂ we see that all
these segments are usually present, but the segments S₂O₂ are
predominant. As an illustration, here is Tiruppukaḻ 200. The first
portion comprises segments (S<sub>1</sub>)S<sub>2</sub>:

> "I was ensnared and smitten with love \
> of maids whose tresses are fragrant night, \
> I was attached to mountain-like breasts \
> of women arousing lust, \
> fed by desirous lips \
> of females skilled in Madana's tricks!" \

Next comes the segment O<sub>1</sub>:

> "But you have never forgotten \
> your friendship, \
> you have not left me alone \
> enmeshed in desire, \
> you have endured my sins \
> and you gave your grace \
> to live in the shade of your sacred feet \
> and grasp your eternal bliss!" \

And, finally, O<sub>2</sub> which is quite developed:

> "O Guha, master of Śiva, \
> lover of Vaḷḷi, your bride! \
> You dwell in Tiruvēṟakam \
> on Kāviri's northern shores \
> with fully-grown shady groves, \
> sweet child of Umai, Gaņeṣa's brother, \
> great hero, destroyer of demoniac pride!" \

O<sub>2</sub> is of course based on both Sanskritic and Tamil mythology:
Guha is Aryan--but the lover of Vaḷḷi is Tamil; child of Umai, brother
of Gaṇeṣa, destroyer of the demons is probably Sanskritic; but he
who lives in Tiruvēṟakam on the shores of Kāviri is indigenous.

> "Those women \
> with swaying breasts \
> lovely red hands \
> filled with bangles \
> as they jingle \
> with dark cloud-like tresses \
> where bees sing \
> and soft beseeching words like the *kuyil* \
> lovely as the five-coloured parrots \
> their voices honey \
> \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ fish-like eyes \
> \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ vieing \
> \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ warm with fear \
> their forehead a crescent moon \
> By them I was lured \
> in their magical ways \
> into this sea of birth \
> Your slave am I \
> Help me reach the shore \
> of your brave noble feet \
> Conquer and bless me". \
>  \
> *(Tiruppukal* ii, 26) \
> (Transl. S. Kokilam) \

This motive appears again and again: Aruṇakiri, the sinner and
Aruṇakiri, the saint; temptation and redemption. Though the
material and the form are very much alike, yet no two stanzas
repeat themselves in a dull and uninteresting manner.

> "Two tusks of black elephants \
> are those mountainous breasts \
> sparkling with gold chains \
> Lovely forehead \
> lovelier than the crescent moon \
> Are they sharp spears \
> those beautiful eyes? \
> Like the dark nightfall \
> their tresses flow \
> They come these women \
> who trade for wealth \
> with sweet words \
> with soft caresses \
> These lewd women lured me \
> into their homes \
> into a life filled with *karma* \
> This wasted sinner \
> Give me the strength \
> to reach your noble feet \
> Give me the joy of enlightenment". \
> 
> (Transl. S. Kokilam) \

In the second type of Aruṇakiri's poetry-the philosophical
stanzas with no autobiographical material—the segments (O₁) O2 are
usually the only segments present. As an illustration, a perfectly
beautiful quatrain form *Kantaraṇupūti* (51) may be quoted. First
the music of the original:

> *uruvāy aruvāy ulatāy ilatāy* \
> *maruvāy malaray maṇiyāy oļiyāyk* \
> *karuvāy uyirāy katiyāy vitiyāyk* \
> *kuruvay varuvāy aruļvāy kukanē* \
>  \
> "You who have form and who are formless, \
> you who are both being and non-being, \
> who are the fragrance and the blossom, \
> who are the jewel and its lustre, \
> who are the seed of life and life itself, \
> who are the mode and act of existence, \
> who are supreme guru, come \
> and bestow your grace, o Guha”. \

I suggest that this stanza is no "word-jugglery” but perfection
itself as far as philosophic poetry goes—both in thought-content
and in form: a whole philosophy is expressed in three lines of poetry
which sounds like music. This is Aruṇakiri's real greatness: he has
reached extreme limits in his masterly use of the phonaesthetic
qualities of Tamil, and such stanzas are therefore untranslatable.

I mentioned two properties of his poetry: his exceptionally
copious vocabulary, and the use of *cantam*; the other two properties
are his supreme skill in *vanṇam* or 'colour of sounds', and
in the *ōcai* or 'basic tone and rhythmic flow' of his stanzas.

*vaṇṇam* (Skt. *varṇa*) is the prevalent phonaesthetic quality of
a stanza, determined by the quantitative relations and structural
positions of vocoid and contoid phonemes. Aruṇakiri is famous for
this feature of his poems. The stanza from *Kantaranupūti* which
was just quoted is an instance of a prevalent *iṭaiyina vaṇṇam* or
"sonant, liquid colour" (prevalence of y,r,*l, v*, 1, *1)*. The stanza is,
however, carefully patterned from the point of its thought-content,
too the basic principle being that of positive: negative pairs and
pairs of actor: action or result.

*uru(vu)* "form": *aru(vu)* "formlessness"
*ulatu* "existence": *ilatu* "non-existence"
*malar* "blossom”: *maru* “fragrance"
*maṇi* "jewel": *oḷi* "lustre"
*karu* "seed" *uyir* "life"
*kati* “mode”: *viti* “act"

Some of his poems are a blend of reflection and prayer, like the
following one *(Tiruppukal* VI.186):

> "We need clothes \
> to dress \
> Rich drink to quench our thirst \
> To be resplendent lovely attire \
> water and perfumes \
> To cure ills medicine \
> A young wife for a home \
> A cottage to rest \
> as protector of kith and kin \
> Life passes by \
> as it withers aimless \
> \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ So \
> be merciful to me \
> Give me the knowledge \
> of realization \
> Redeem me from this *karma* \
> the swirling mountain of life \
> Will there come a day \
> when you will reach this slave?" \
> 
> (Transl. S. Kokilam) \

Finally, as an instance of the pure prayers, praises, hymns
addressed to Murukaṉ, we have chosen one in which Aruṇakiri the
*bhakta* points to himself as a maid of the Lord *(Tiruppukal* V.69):

> "Lord with the spear \
> worshipped by \
> the spouse \
> the mountain kings' daughter \
> the spouse of the daughter of learning \
> the spouse of the daughter of wealth \
> You \
> with the deer of the millet fields \
> with the deer of the heavenly groves \
> in love embraced \
> in your merciful arms \
> Rescue \
> this daughter of the earth \
> where great poets stray \
> with your golden-rayed spear \
> residing on the hills of Tiruttaṇi \
> You redeem those lonely followers \
> all day mounted \
> on your beautiful peacock \
> O pride of prides! \
> Those bedecked women \
> with luring words \
> mingled with the sounds of horns \
> and the call of black *kuyils* from the shore \
> echo of the sea \
> merged with waves of thoughts \
> From the murderous arrows of Manmatan \
> rescue this woman with creeper-like waist \
> from being destroyed in sorrows \
> You adorned with the *kura* flower \
> grant me your garland of kaṭappa blossoms \
> strung round your wide arms!" \
> \
> (Transl. S. Kokilam) \

When two great poets meet, we may expect a happy outcome.
This is in fact the case of a stanza of Aruṇakiri, translated into
English by Subrahmanya Bharati (1882-1921), and published in
his *Agni and Other Poems*:

> "Like a child unto the barren womb, \
> Like a mine of new-found treasures, \
> Like a floor of diamonds, \
> so be my songs. \
>  \
> Like the wilful embrace of Love's soft bosom, \
> Like a string of the purest gems, \
> Like a garden of fragrant blossoms, \
> Like the river that descends from heaven, \
> even so be my songs. \
> Like the daughter of the ocean, \
>  \
> Like eyes unto poets, \
> Like a stream full to the brim easy to drink of, \
> Like the vase of the nectar of Thy beauty, \
> So be my wondrous songs of love, \
> by Thy grace, o Lord". \

Lastly, there is one more feature of Aruṇakiri's poetry that
should be mentioned: his conception of Murukaṉ. True to the
ancient, almost pre-historic tradition, Murukaṉ and Tamil are one
for Aruṇakiri. Murukaṉ, the "lion who presides over the famous
bards of powerful speech" *(Tirumurukārṛuppaṭai*), is the supreme
patron of poetry, and the god of the Tamil language.

> "The bridegroom of Vaḷḷi \
> with tresses adorned with garlands \
> is ready to foster \
> even those who curse and abusein \
> threefold Tamil!" \

And, elsewhere, Aruṇakiri cries out, full of rapture, in verses in
which Tamil and Sanskrit blend in resonant music:

> *muttamil* vitva \
> *vinōtā! kītā*! \
> *marravar* oppilā \
> *rūpā*! tīpā! \
>  \
> "O beauty, o wisdom of three-fold Tamil! \
> O song! \
> Incomparable, unique Form ! \
> O light!" \
