# DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF TAMIL LITERATURE

One may observe, through the entire development of Tamil
literature and, for that matter, Tamil culture in general, a kind of
inner tension which may be traced to two sources: one is the truly
dialectic relationship between the general and the specific, another
the conflict between tradition and modernity. The problem of the
relation of specific and general in Tamil literature and culture is a
very central, very basic problem which has its important aspects in
all spheres of life and which penetrates or at least touches a great
number of other questions (such as the biculturalism of some strata
of the Tamil community, the language-loyalty, language policy etc.).
By “general” I mean the generally, the universally Indian, by
"specific” I mean the specifically, distinctively Tamil.
There is much talk today about the Indian linguistic area; after
Emeneau applied the theory of a *Sprachbund* to India and so-to-say
discovered India, in 1956, as a “linguistic area”, as an area in which
genetically different languages show similar or even identical
features, we should probably develop, along analogical lines of
thinking, an Indian areal *Literaturwissenschaft*, with the same
precision, with the same attention to detail, with the same rigour
that Emeneau develops in his hypothesis of Indian linguistic area.
There is no doubt that there are some “emic” features, typical for
the pan-Indian *Literaturbund.¹* Hardly anybody can deny that there
1 Features which are common to the entire Indian sub-continent but
unique only for it; not confined to any particular region or bound by any
particular linguistic unit or social community. Examples of such features
(seen, naturally, in a somewhat "collapsed" form) are, e.g., high degree of
conceptualization and categorizing science against low degree of factgathering
and hypotheses-testing; the conception of time as circular rather
than linear, etc. etc. In the field of literature, its function and appreciation,
such features are, to quote a few instances: higher regard for oral than for
written transmission; emphasis on audience appreciation; the concept of
"mood" *(rasa* in Sanskrit, *meyppāțu* in Tamil) and its over-all importance—
though the Tamil *meyppāțu* is not identical, but an important "alloform"
of the over-all category of "mood"; literature as rhetoric to move others, to
intensify the feelings of the *rasika;* composition is prescribed; there is therefore
high degree of conventionalization; characters analyzed rather by types
than by individual heroes; high degree of anonymity, a typical Indian




is a common Indianness in the literatures of India just as there are
some common and distinctive features of Indian civilization and
culture (though I have my doubts whether anybody has as yet
successfully produced a classified list and a really deep and penetrating
discussion of these features). These common features are of
course results of a converging evolution; or, one should probably
say, and this seems to me to be rather important, of a synthesis not
yet fully achieved, actually far from achieved. The common
Indianness, the “unity in diversity", should be regarded not as
something static and finished, but as a dynamic process, as a truly
dialectical process; not as a sum, but as a movement which alters in
the historical evolution, a kind of striving after synthesis of oppositions
and conflicts which are frequently rather antagonistic.
One of the basic-if not the basic-components of this dynamic
process full of tensions and antagonisms is the striving after a
Dravidian-Aryan synthesis. Tamil literature reflects this struggle,
from its very beginnings in the text of the *Tolkāppiyam* until today's
writings of such men as Annadurai, Kannadasan or other apostles of
the Dravidian movement on the one hand, and, on the other hand,
in the writings of the synthesis-oriented, "Sanskritized" Brahmin
writers.

As mentioned above, it is very probable that the first bloom of
Tamil culture and literature took place before that type of diffusion
which had been termed “Sanskritization" could have had any massive
effect and any structurally deep impact upon the indigenous,
pre-Aryan culture of the South. This does not, however, mean that
even the earliest strata of classical Tamil culture are without any
traces of "Sanskritization". In fact, diffusion of at least some of the
"Sanskritic" traits must have taken place as early as in the ProtoTamil
or pre-Tamil stage, since, as Emeneau pointed out, these
traits are very ancient in Toda culture, possessed by the Todas
probably when they first appeared in the Nilgiris. As Emeneau says,
Sanskritic culture has, indeed, been all-pervasive in India.
The very earliest monument of Tamil literary language and
Tamil culture as such, the *Tolkāppiyam*, supposed to have been
composed by Agastya's pupil *Tolkāppiyar*, is to a great extent the
product of an Aryan-Dravidian synthesis; and even in its *Urtext*, in
its earliest layers, it shows beyond doubt the author's well-digested
conception of authorship, originality and imitation; a particular conception
of plot(s) etc. etc.

knowledge of such Sanskrit authors as Pāṇini and Patañjali. The
earliest traces of another style of Tamil-a style probably rather
near to the colloquial speech of those days-preserved in the most
ancient inscriptions in Tamil in the Brāhmī script-are influenced to
a considerable extent by the Prakrit of the Jains and the Pali of the
Buddhists.

Hence it is clear that Tamil literature did not develop in a cultural
vacuum, and that the evolution of the Tamil culture was not
achieved either in isolation, or by simple cultural mutation. The
very beginnings of Tamil literature manifest clear traces of Aryan
influence just as the very beginnings of the Indo-Aryan literature,
the Rgvedic hymns, show traces of Dravidian influence. This, too,
is today an undisputed fact.

On the other hand, there are some sharply contrasting features
which are typical for Tamil classical culture alone, for the Tamil
cultural and literary tradition as opposed to the non-Tamil tradition
-and in this respect, the Tamil cultural tradition is independent,
not derived, not imitative; it is pre-Sanskritic, and from this point
of view Tamil alone stands apart when compared with all other
major languages and literatures of India.

It is possible to express this fact briefly but precisely by saying
that there exist in India only two great specific and independent
classical and historically attested cultures-the Sanskritic culture
and the Tamil culture.

Historically speaking, from the point of development of Indian
literature as a single complex, Tamil literature possesses at least
two unique features.

First, as has just been pointed out, it is the only Indian literature
which is, at least in its beginnings and in its first and most vigorous
bloom, almost entirely independent of Aryan and specifically
Sanskrit influences. This primary independence of Tamil literary
tradition has been, incidentally, the source of many conflicts.
Second: though being sometimes qualified as a neo-Indian literature,
Tamil literature is the only Indian literature which is both
classical and modern; while it shares antiquity with much of
Sanskrit literature and is as classical, in the best sense of the word,
as e.g. the ancient Greek poetry, it continues to be vigorously living
modern writing of our days. This fact was expressed in a very happy
formulation by A. K. Ramanujan in his excellent book The *Interior*
*Landscape* (1967): "Tamil, one of the two classical languages of




India, is the only language of contemporary India which is recognizably
continuous with a classical past”.

_
This fact the relation between tradition and modernity-has, too,
been the source of constant tension: contemporary Tamil literature
has to carry the splendid but massive burden of an uninterrupted
tradition and classical heritage, and sometimes the burden seems
indeed too heavy to bear.

The following are then the diagnostic, characteristic features of
classical Tamil literature with regard to its subject-matter and
 thought-content. First of all, Tamil is probably the one ancient
language of India that bears the reflection of the life of an entire
people; that is, its heroes are idealized types derived from what we
might even call “common folk”. Classical (i.e. the so-called *Caṅkam*)
Tamil literature is not the literature of the barons; neither is it the
literature of a monastic order; nor the literature of an *élite*, of a
*nāgarika*; it is thus not the literature of a particular social class.
One major type of Tamil classical poems reflects the life of ordinary
though idealized men and women, not the life of a sacerdotal or
ruling nobility, of a priestly class, of nuns, monks, or of any *élite*
group or groups of society. The whole gamut of basic human
experience is contained in what has been best in Tamil writing.
In this sense, it is very different from all strata of Sanskritic
literature from the Vedic literature which is the literature of
a sacerdotal class, from the great epics which are the literature of
the ruling barons, from the classical literature which is *par excellence*
the literature of the "man about town", of the *nāgarika*; it is also
different from the Buddhist and Jaina texts, since these are mostly
the literature of monastic orders, of monks and nuns. However, this
does not mean that it is, in its finished form, as we have it, "popular"
literature or "folk" literature. Classical Tamil literature is literature
about and of people but not a *Volksliteratur*. It is typically a
*Kunstdichtung.*

The poets, of both sexes, had no priestly function to perform.
There are more than twenty women minstrels, responsible for about
140 poems of the earliest strata of Tamil poetry. The true diagnostic
feature of these poets is the fact that they were a professional,
vocational group, held generally in high esteem. They belonged, by
birth, to all classes of society; quite a number of them were born as
princes and chieftains; a great number were of peasant or merchant
origin; however, the list of ancient poets includes potters, blacksmiths
and carpenters-by birth, that is. Some of the names are
revealing: e.g. Nampi Kuṭṭuvaṉ, Kur. 243, belonged to the ruling
dynasty of the *Cēral* kings; Maturai Eḻuttāḷaṉ, Kur. 223, was
probably a scribe at the royal court of *Maturai*; Uṟaiyūr Mutukorran,
*Kur*. 221, is the "old headman of *Uṟaiyūr",* but Kiḷimaṅkalaṅkiḻār,
*Kur*. 152, was a peasant by caste, while e.g. Māmūlaṉār,
responsible for a number of poems, was a Brahmin scholar.
These early poets, recruited from many different communities,
received bardic training-there were probably different schools and
traditions of this training—and became professionals; the wandering
minstrels and bards travelled about in groups, often rather poor,
frequently, however, very influential, and sometimes rather
affluent. When a poet in Puṟ. 208. 7-8 says: "I am not singing for
money" and "I am not a poet who barters his art", it implies the
existence of "mercenary" singers. Some of the poems speak even of
the duty, of the obligation (*katan,* lit. "debt") towards the minstrels
which the ruling monarchs and chieftains have to perform *(Pur.*
201. 14, 203. II).

The learning of the minstrels was oral, acquired by imitation and
practice; the basis of their knowledge was purely auditory. Cf. the
term kēḷvi "learning" (specifically of the poets): primary meaning
"hearing, sound” (<*kēļ*), or kiḷavi "word, speech, language,
utterance" <*kiļa* "to speak", i.e. "to be heard" (*DED* 1677,
Burrow *BSOAS* 1943, 128); kiḷavi is used most frequently for
"poetic utterance": all this points to the oral-auditory nature of
early Tamil literature.

In this connection it is also interesting to note that the term for
the most ancient Tamil metre, the metre in which almost the entire
bardic poetry is sung, namely *akaval,* means "call, summon, song"
(cf. *DED* 11 *akavu* "to utter a sound as a peacock, to sing, call,
summon", *akavar* "bards who arouse the king in the morning”).
Later the same metre was called *āciriyam*, derived from *āciri yan*
"priest, teacher, author of any literary work, scholar", a very
early lw. from Skt. *ācārya-* “a spiritual guide or teacher" (*DBIA,*
item 30). That is, there was a semantic shift from "call, summon,
song" to "teaching, sermon, explanation". The poetry acquires
more and more the character of learned *Kunstdichtung*, and this
also leads, as Kailasapathy rightly observes, to the next stage of
gnomic, didactic poetry (under the increasing impact of Jaina and
Buddhist ideology).



But let us return to the bards: there were probably six major
types of these early poets: the term which is used most frequently is
pāṇar: This is connected with paṇ “song, melody", pāṇi “song,
melody, music" and *pāņu* “song"; most probably the underlying
monosyllabic morpheme is *paṇ* "music". There are cognates in
Malayalam and Tulu. It is interesting that the Pkt. pāṇa- (most
probably connected) means “a low caste" *(DED* 3351). The *pāṇar*
were minstrels who sang their songs to the accompaniment of the
*yāḻ* or lute. In medieval times, they were regarded as a lower caste,
and in such medieval texts as the *Nantikkalampakam* (anonymous,
of the time of Pallava Nandivarman III, 846-869; historically a
reliable text), the *pāṇar* are compared with *pēy,* “the devils, the
demons", and with *nay*, "the dogs".

*kūttar* were dancing minstrels, performers of choral dramas (a
synonymous term is *āṭunar*). Cf. Greek *choroi* who sang as well as
danced at the festivals. This class of minstrels was degraded, too:
kūtti "danseuse" in later time means "prostitute".

*porunar*: a term which probably means "war-bards"; they were
especially close to the chiefs and princes; the accompanying
instrument in this case was the *taṭāri* or *kiṇai* “small drum".
*akavunar, akavalar* or *akavar* <*akavu* “to utter a sound as a peacock,
to sing, call, summon", i.e. "summoners, callers". Probably
"heralds". We also come across the term *akavaṉ makaļir* “women
heralds".

*viṟaliyar*: these were female dancers and singers; originally highly
respected cf. the case of Auvaiyār, who was a great and esteemed
poetess and a danseuse. In later times, however, mainly due to the
puritanical attitude of Jainism and Buddhism, they became to be
regarded as symbols of immorality, and the word was used first
for concubines, later for harlots and prostitutes.

The only term which survived in the meaning "poet" was
*pulavar*. This is the modern Standard Literary Tamil term (in
de-Sanskritized Tamil). Original meaning is "wise men, the learned".
And this itself is important: the idea of wisdom, of knowledge, of
learning connected with the person of the poet; it was a learned
poetry. It also shows the reverence for the poets in ancient times:
the *pulavar* are always highly respected-somewhat like in the
Jewish tradition: a scholar is the most respected man in the society.
It seems from certain data that poets have not only been always


associated with profound learning, but also with mantic wisdom,
which was connected, again, with the cult of *Murukaṉ.* Murukaṉ is
actually the patron-god of poets and scholars in the South; only
much later this function (of the patron-god of wisdom and learning)
is taken over by Gaṇapati.

In a way, ancient Tamil poetry, especially the erotic poetry, is
very "democratic". However, this democratism, I am afraid, was
greatly exaggerated.[^exaggerated] The characters mentioned by name in the
*heroic* poetry are almost exclusively aristocratic. On the other hand,
in *love-poetry*, the personnel is anonymous-they are types, typified
common people or rather people in general, without any determination
of their social status, their occupation, etc.: just a man and a
woman, the woman's mother or girl-friend, the man's friend or his
charioteer. However, there is evidence which shows that even these
anonymous types belong, in most of the erotic poems, to the "leisure
class". We may assume that, with a few exceptions, one and the
same type of male is the hero of both--the war exploits and the
erotic feats. The only difference is that when the poet describes his
erotic achievements, he is discreetly anonymous, while anonymity in
panegyric and heroic poetry would be quite unwanted; here, the
hero is a concrete person. There is no personal love-poetry. The
poet never speaks about his individual erotic experience; on the
other hand, there is a lot of personal experience of the poet revealed
in the poems from the other sphere--the sphere of public life.
The male hero, though an "aristocrat", cannot be compared with
let us say a feudal baron of the Norman period. The Old Tamil hero
was very close to the land, the economic basis of his existence,
though he himself did probably no manual work in the fields; he did
not live in huge castles, but in villages in big houses called *maṉai*,
*akam*, il, and only occasionally in small fortresses. However, as
*Puṟam* 311 says,

[^exaggerated]: I would now hesitate to use the term at all. It is true that, on the one
hand, the akam genre of classical poetry has for its *dramatis personae* anonymous
types representative of men and women an *sich* (irrespective, among
other features, of caste or class) who undergo common and total human
experience of love in all its phases and aspects; on the other hand, these
idealized types represent cultured, well-matched and fit pairs, to the exclusion
of uncultured, ignorant, unfit people, who, in later scholastic literature,
are said explicitly to be servants and workers. The ideology of the
puṟam (heroic) genre is definitely "clannish" and "aristocratic".

> "he wears spotless white clothes washed by the pulaitti (washer-
> woman), who digs the salt land for water. He also wears a garland
> of flowers. He is always helpful to others. But he fights alone,
> unaided in battle. A fierce and mighty hero, he is, who wards
> off with his single shield the weapons aimed at him by his foes"
> (K. Kailasapathy's transl.).

_
The bards did not indulge in moralizations concerning either the
ethics of war or the problems of extramarital relationship or nonmonogamous
sexuality of the heroes (Kailasapathy, 79, 80). Only
later—probably due to the impact of Jainism, Buddhism and later
Brahmanism there is some gnomic content in the poems—the
central idea being the impermanence of life in the world: *Tolkāppi-*
*yam* calls this theme *kāňci*, and *Puṟapporuḷ veṇpāmālai* calls it
*vākai*. They stand apart, probably as later additions. Whether they
are later or not, all of them are to an extent pervaded by some conception
of universal humanism and unity of mankind. The reasons
for this humanism are not drawn from a monistic identity with the
Primeval Being, but from the very nature of man, from the fundamental
identity of all men, from a rational unity found in nature
and in the cosmos; above all, from a stoic-like, unimpassioned,
imperturbable kind of acceptance of the facts of life. In these few
stanzas, we see the poet-philosopher, or rather simply the "wise
poet", the *pulavar,* at his best, whether or not we regard these
poems as a reflection of the progressive transformation of values,
which were originally pertinent simply and purely to the heroic age,
into more idealized values, interpreted from the moral standpoint.
Whatever the process was, the outcome, represented e.g. by the
well-known and often quoted poem beginning *yātum ūrē yāvaruṅ*
*kēḷir, Puṟam* 192, played a very great role in subsequent ideological
development, and is probably even more important today in its
very contemporary political interpretations, and even misinterpretations.
The whole context of the poem shows that we have to do
rather with a stoic-like, Montaignesque resignation and even a
privileged recognition of the transiency of life, than with any kind
of egalitarianism and "universal brotherhood" which had been
read into the opening line of this beautiful poem.

<blockquote>
Any town our home-town, every man a kinsman.<br/>
Evil and good are not things brought<br/>
by others; neither pain, nor relief of pain.<br/>
Death is nothing new. We do not rejoice.<br/>
that living is sweet, nor resent it.<br/>
for not being so.<br/>
Life's way is like the raft's<br/>
when the restless descending waters lash on the rocks<br/>
as lightening skies pour down the rains<br/>
we know this very well<br/>
from the vision of the Open-eyed Ones.<br/>
So we do not marvel at those<br/>
big with excellence, nor scorn<br/>
the little ones.<br/>

*Puṟam* 192<br/>
Translation: A. K. Ramanujan<br/>
</blockquote>


The ideal of human life was to be achieved in this life; and it was
the ideal of a wise man of human proportions and with human
qualities. There is even a specific term for this ideal man, appearing
again and again in many stanzas-in fact one of the key-words of
Tamil poetry, if not the key-word of the best in Tamil culture. I
have in mind the term *cāṉṟōr*. This is a participial noun derived
from the verb stem *cal* "to be abundant, full, suitable, filling, great,
noble"; the noun *cāl* means “fullness, abundance”*, cālpu* “excellence,
nobility" (*DED* 2037 a). Hence *cāṉṟōṉ*, pl. *cāṉṟōr* means “a
complete, a whole man, a perfect, noble man".

Actually the medieval glossators and scholiasts called consistently
the most ancient poetry of the Tamils *cāṉṟōr ceyyuḷ!* "poetry of the
noble ones". K. Kailasapathy adds the following very true statement
about this term: "It is perhaps no great exaggeration to
say that no other expression sums up the totality of the nature
of the earliest Tamil poetry as does *cāṉṟōr ceyyuḷ* 'poetry of the
noble ones". The TL iii 1397 gives the following meanings of
*cāṉṟōr*: “the warrior, the great, the learned, the noble”, and “the
poets of the *Caṅkam* period”. In a book of essays, *Aňciṟaittumpi*,
on pp. 49-64, M. S. Venkataswamy discussed this word and its
semantic field and tried to demonstrate that it originally connoted
"warriors". That may be true: but in the bulk of so-called Sangam
poetry, it means "great, noble men" (in the moral sense). A stanza,
*Puṟam* 182, maintains that the world exists as a liveable place because
such perfect men exist.

> This world lives because \
> some men do not eat alone, even the sweetest things, \
> nor even the food of the gods \
> earned by grace and penance; \
> they have no anger in them; \
> they do not fear evils that other men fear, \
> nor sleep over them; \
> they give their lives for glory \
> but will not touch the gifts of the whole worlds \
> if it should be tainted; \
> they have no faintness in their hearts, \
> and strive not for themselves \
> but for others; \
> this world is, \
> because such men are. \
>
> *Puṟam* 182 \
> Translation: A. K. Ramanujan \

Again, in another stanza of the anthology, *Puṟam* 191, we may
read the following lines:

> You ask me how it is \
> my hair is not gray \
> though I am full of years. Then listen: \
> a wife's excellence; children fulfilled; \
> dear ones wishing me what I wish \
> for myself; a king who will do nothing \
> that isn't done; and in the town \
> where I live, several men \
> full of virtue, courtesy, \
> masters of their senses. \
>
> *Puṟam* 191 \
> Translation: A. K. Ramanujan \

The same idea reappears later in the *Tirukkuṟaḷ* (e.g. in 571, 996);
*paṇpuṭaiyār paṭṭuṉ tulakam*; *atuviṉṟeṉ*
*maṇpukku māyvatu man* (996)
"The world exists because noble and cultured men exist; without
them the world would vanish in dust".

The important fact is that this Tamil wise man, the *cāṉṟōṉ*, is
not an anchorite or a recluse, not an ascetic of any kind and shade,
but a man of flesh and blood who should live fully his days of
courtship and of married life, of fighting and love-making, rejoicing
in the laughter and happiness with his children and friends and
fully dedicated to his social and civic duties. And this humanistic
tradition is very much alive in Tamil literature from its beginnings
to its present short-story writing, and is found strongly expressed in
the best works of Tamil literature: in the earliest poetry which is


its source, in the pragmatic and empiric ethics of the *Tirukkuṟaḷ,* in
the best of the *bhaktas,* in the conception of Kampaṉ's Ayodhyā, and
even in the medieval poets like Pukaḻēnti and Aruṇakiri, in Rāmaliṅka
Cuvāmi and, much later, in the two probably greatest figures
of new Tamil writing, in Pārati (Bharati) and Putumaippittaṉ.
Before discussing another general characteristic feature of Tamil
writing as such, let me trace in some detail the other key-words,
the other diagnostic concepts typical for the earliest and most
independent era of Tamil literature and thought.

One of such terms is *nāṇ* “sense of shame”. According to the most
accurate and sensible commentator on early old Tamil literature,
Iḷampūraṇar, "what is meant by this word is a state of mind that
leads to the actions contrary to the conduct of the noble ones; it
cannot be explained"*. Akam* 273.15 speaks about *pulavar pukaḻnta*
*nāṇ* "sense of shame praised by the bards".

Another key-term, and probably even more important, is *pukaḻ*,
and its many synonyms, all meaning "glory", "fame". According to
*Puṟam* 282, the ideal hero while alive lived in the battle ground to
attain "gloire"; and after death he passed into the verses of the
singers. To acquire fame and glory was the chief goal of his life.
In *Puṟam* 36 it is said that "for fame they would give their very
lives; against blame even the entire world they would not have".
And again, *Puṟam* 182. 5 says *pukaḻeṉiṉ uyiruṅ koṭukkuvar* “for
fame they would give their very lives". The synonyms for *pukaḻ* are
*urai, icai*, *perumpeyar, cīrtti*, all meaning, “praise, fame". K. Kailasapathy
examines in detail the contents and attributes of these
items (231 ff.). The poems are saturated with constructions involving
these terms. The warrior constantly endeavours to establish his
reputation, he is full of courage, having utter disclaim for death.
One's fame is more lasting than death itself, cf. *Puṟam* 165.2 etc.
*tampukaḷ niṟīit tāmmāyntaṉar* "they died, having set up their fame
on a firm basis". Honour and fame could be achieved only by
bravery in war and deeds of slaughter against the enemy. The true
hero longs for battle. Cf. *Akam* 154. 3-4: "Having consumed plenty
of strong palm-wine, the furious men long for battle". Hence the
hero's pride in wounds received in battle, in *viḻuppuṇ* “excellent
wounds" (*Puram* 180. 4.) which, according to the celebrated
commentator of the Tirukkuṟaḷ, Parimēlaḻakar *(Kuṛaļ* 76.
6), are "glorious wounds which one receives ..

... on one's chest and
face".





Women were as brave and as thirsty for fame as men: cf. this
amazing poem, *Puṟam* 86:

> You stand against the pillar \
> of my hut and ask me: \
> Where is your son? \
> I don't really know. \
> My womb is only a lair \
> for that tiger. \
> You can see him now \
> only in battlefields. \
>
> Translation: A. K. Ramanujan \

With the longing for battle and thirst for fame is naturally
connected the earliest Tamil conception of heaven. It is a hero's
heaven, the world of great renown, the world of the noble ones;
whereas the earth is peopled by heroes and non-heroes, the warrior's
heaven is inhabited only by renowned *(perumpeyar*) persons. They
will enjoy the bliss of marriage with the spotless maidens in heaven
*(Puram* 287. 10-12). "Lucky are those who are killed by someone
rather than just die” *(Akam* 61.1-2). Those who died a natural death
were laid on a grass mat and cut asunder with a sword, so that they
might die a warrior's death. Even children did not escape this
gruesome custom, cf. *Puṟam* 74. 1-2: "Whether it be a still-born
child or a mere foetus, it is not spared but cloven asunder”.
Leaving these gruesome aspects of early Tamil civilization behind,
let me mention another and very typical and characteristic feature
of the pre-Aryan Tamil literature-its predominantly secular
inspiration, the absence of any "religious" sentiment. The earliest
extant poetry is emphatically not ritualistic at all; even reflection
and didactic features appear later. It was suspected and hinted at
more than once, and probably quite conclusively proved by Kailasapathy,
that the early poetry of the Tamils is founded on *secular,*
*oral bardic* tradition-in sharp contrast to the Vedic poetry, and
comparable rather with the Greek or Welsh bardic literature and, in
some respects, with the early amorous lyric poetry of the *trobadors*
of Languedoc and Provence.

The Tamil classical poetry is pre-eminently of this world; it makes
almost no allusions to supernatural meddling in worldly affairs.
When, quite marginally and exceptionally, it reflects some kind of
*religio*, it is mostly the rites and ceremonies connected with the
daily life of the people (such as marriage ceremonies), or, in bardic
war-poetry, reflections of tribal cults and their survivals (sacrifice
of blood and flesh to the devils, etc.). The presence of Vedic religion,
of Brahmanism, in early Tamil poetry may be traced only with
difficulty as a very feeble, unimportant superstratum.

The poetry only rarely reflects and speculates; where reflexion and
elements of speculation appear, they are often of very different
quality from what we find in Aryan texts: in old Tamil literature,
reflections and speculations are of a general, humanistic and “stoic"
character, preoccupied mostly with the impermanence and transience
of human affairs, with man's duties as a zoon politikon and as a
social being, with the ability to live a full, happy life in this world.
This original secularism and the absence of almost any religious
inspiration is the one feature that later disappears from Tamil
literature, and Tamil becomes what has been called “the language of
devotion" and of religious philosophy. But Tamil religiosity is
undoubtedly of a different colour than any other Indian religiosity;
it has its specific and peculiar features, which will be discussed in
detail when Tamil *bhakti* poetry, and the *cittar* texts, are analysed.
Apart from these more general typical features of Tamil literature
-its so-called “democratism", humanism and secularism--we may
of course characterize Tamil writing by its typical subject-matters,
by its leading themes and motives. The traditional and in fact the
only content of ancient Tamil poetry seems again to be something
specific in India, and any attempt to bring it into direct relationship
and one-to-one correspondence with the concepts of *dharma* or
*artha* or *kāma* is bound to fail. To put it simply and somewhat
crudely, the two topics of early Tamil poetry are mating and
fighting. This fact finds its formal expression in the existence of
two and only two genres. The genre of *akam* poetry, i.e. poetry of
the "inner world", speaks of private life. This is the tender, intimate
love-poetry, anonymous, stereotyped, including some of the greatest
love poems ever composed in world literature: a poetry based on a
concept definitely broader and deeper than the Sanskritic *kāma*.
The second genre is that of *puṟam*, of the “outer world", poetry
concerning individual heroes; about war, greatness, fame and duty;
about public and political life; the result-magnificent bardic
poetry, panegyrics and war lyrics. The genre comprises a great
many aspects of the Sanskritic *dharma* and *artha.*

Finally, there is yet another feature which should be mentioned,
a formal feature which is perhaps rather typical of the best achieve-


ments of Tamil literature as such, from the earliest exquisite lyrical
stanzas to the quite contemporary prose-writings of such authors as
L. S. Ramamirtham or the very contemporary putu *kavitai,* “new
poetry" school. It seems somehow that the thing which matters
most in Tamil creative writing *is* a conscious effort after brevity and
conciseness, a striving after powerful abbreviation, clarity and
transparence, which is the result of much effort to exploit to the
utmost the technique of suggestion, of allusion, of inference and
word-play, of a complex and telling use of imagery, of multiple
overtones. This effort may be seen in the earliest lyrical stanzas as
well as in the intensely concise couplets of the *Tirukkuṟaḷ,* in the
songs of *Cilappatikāram*, in various stanzas of Kampaṉ's epic, in
modern essays and short stories.

Hence, the two most typical and best developed forms of Tamil
writing throughout the ages are *lyrical poetry* and *short story*, that is
basically brief forms. Epic poetry appears later, and is almost always
an imitation; even the greatest Tamil epic poetry—with the possible
exception of *Cilappatikāram* and its majestic grandeur-is rather a
series of miniature dramatic situations arranged like a chain of
individual stanzas similar to beads on a string, stanzas which are
finished, homogenous and perfect in themselves. And, frankly
speaking, a *great* novel and a *great* drama has yet to appear in
Tamil literature, whereas Tamil poetry abounds in exquisite lyrical
pieces and Tamil prose abounds in excellent short stories and
essays.
