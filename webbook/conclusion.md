# Conclusion {.unnumbered}


Many unorthodox views were expressed on the preceding pages,
and I am almost certain that they will meet with disapproval in
some quarters. However, I strongly believe in the interpenetration
of literary history and literary criticism. As Wellek and Warren
rightly say, "There are simply no data in literary history which
are completely neutral 'facts'. Value judgements are implied in the
very choice of materials: in the simple preliminary distinction
between books and literature, in the mere allocation of space to
this or that author".[^wellek-warren-citation] Let me in conclusion sum up some of the
views expressed in this book, in order to facilitate the orientation
of those who wish to contest them.

[^wellek-warren-citation]: René Wellek-Austin Warren, *Theory* of *Literature*, 3rd ed., 1963, p. 40.

I have expressed the opinion that the Tolkāppiyam, as we have
it today, is not an integral and untampered with text, a work of
one single author, but rather the work of an entire scholastic group,
with a number of additions and interpolations, the final redaction
of which is comparatively late (middle of the 1st Millennium A.D.);
and that, possibly, the whole third book (*Poruḷatikāram*) is later
than the first two portions.

I disagree with the conception that early classical (Caṅkam)
poetry was "democratic in spirit". I believe that this poetry—the
best which has ever been composed in the Tamil language—is
basically aristocratic and early feudal in outlook and bardic and
clannish in origin. Judging it purely aesthetically I believe that it
is fully commensurable in quality with the very peaks of world
lyrical poetry, specifically of the "objective" and "professional" type.
I do not consider any of the didactic texts to be truly great
literature not even the Tirukkuṟaḷ. I believe that the "didactic
heresy" was detrimental to both old Tamil poetry and the Tamil
fiction of the 19th-20th Centuries.

Contrary to the opinion of traditional Tamil panditdom, I think
that Iḷaṅkōvaṭikaḷ's "Lay of the Anklet" and not the Rāmāyaṇa
of the *kavicakravarti* Kampaṉ is the greatest single poem in Tamil
literature.

I cannot fully agree with the analysis of bhakti poetry as the
literary expression of social protest. I also consider some of the
*cittar* poets, particularly Tirumūlar and Paṭṭiṉattar, as great
creative poets.

I do not regard S. Bharathi as a great “world-poet" on *a* par with
some other Indian authors such as Vālmīki, Kālidāsa, Iḷaṅkō,
Kampaṉ, or even Tagore and Vallathol.

I think that modern Tamil prose is still rather stagnate and
sterile, though there are a few exceptional authors and a great
promise of future inventive and creative developments. For the
benefit of those who want to read good modern *prosateurs* in Tamil
I shall risk to give a list of names who I believe are truly representative
of good, solid, serious, even exceptional modern Tamil writing:
Mauni (the "Tirumūlar of short story writing" as Putumaippittaṉ
called him), N. Pichamurti, K. Alagiriswamy, R. Shanmugasundaram,
*T. Janakiraman,* S. Ramaswamy, L. S. *Ramamirtham*,
N. Padmanabhan.

I consider the *putukkavitai* movement the greatest achievement
of modern Tamil poetry so far. The names which I would like to
specifically mention in this connection are those of N. Pichamurti,
C. Mani, S. Ramaswamy, D. Sivaramu, Vallikkannan, Hari
Sreenivasan, Shanmugam Subbiah, and, as truly outstanding,
S. Vaitheeswaran and T. S. Venugopalan.

I think that the critical approaches developed in *Eḻuttu* and
*Ilakkiya vaṭṭam* by C. S. Chellappa and K. N. Subrahmanyam are
basically sound and correct, though they tend to be, sometimes,
too iconoclastic, too sophisticated, and too exclusive and clannish.

Finally, I think that the specific glory of Tamil literature, past
and present, is in the "short form”—in lyrical poetry, short story,
essay; while the novel, the drama, and great epos do not belongowing
to a complicated network of causes—to the great achievements
of Tamil.

Above all I believe that the outstanding works of Tamil literature
of the past, and the very interesting writings of the present times,
should be translated, published and spread wide; they intrinsically
belong to the literary heritage of the world and man's culture will
be enriched by their general knowledge.

India Series, Y.M.C.A. Publishing House, Calcutta, 1st ed. 1961, pp. 305.
Index. A fair, mildly critical and rather objective general introduction,
usually quite reliable; good for quick orientation and reference; no doubt the
best which is available for a non-specialist.

1. Meenakshisundaran, T.P., A *History* of *Tamil Literature*, Annamalai
University, Annamalainagar, 1965. Pp. 211. Index. Based on a series of
lectures at the University of Chicago. Not as thorough and reliable as No. 1.

formulations, but also a few superficial portions. Rather essayistic in parts.
Should be read with caution.

1. Meenakshisundaran, T. P., The *Pageant* of *Tamil Literature*, Sekar
Pathippagam, Madras, 1966. Pp. 126. A collection of 21 essays on Tamil
literature, of very uneven quality.

1. Vaiyapuri Pillai, S., *History* of *Tamil Language and Literature*, New
Century Book House, Madras, 1956. Pp. 206. Index. The most scholarly and
the most critical, as well as very richly documented history of Tamil literature
up to the epic age. Based on strict historical methodology; biased rather in
the "overcritical" direction. Contains many misprints and inaccuracies. In
parts, dated. Should be studied by all who want to penetrate deeper into the
problems of Tamil literary history.

good translations of Tamil poetry by J. R. Marr.

Tamil religious hymns and *purāṇas*. Gives contents of a number of literary
works.

1. Ramachandra Dikshitar, V. R., *Studies in Tamil Literature and History,*
University of Madras, Madras, 1936. In some parts, very much dated. The
reader should also be cautious about its datings. Contains a number of
citations.

1.  Purnalingam Pillai, M. S., *Primer of Tamil Literature,* Tinnevelly, 1904.
Very much dated. Must be read with extreme caution. Contains, however, a
real wealth of traditional material, legends, anecdotes, citations. A revised
version appeared under the title *Tamil Literature* in Tinnevelly, 1928. Highly
interesting, but must be read with critical knowledge and extreme caution.

1.  Casie Chitty, Simon, The Tamil *Plutarch*, Containing a Summary

etc.). Very brief, fragmentary and dated.

Pp. 28. Very brief outline, useful only for the very first and basic orientation.
On pp. 22-28 contains a few controversial remarks on modern and contemporary
writing.

### Anthologies of Translations from Tamil Poetry with Annotations

1. Somasundaram Pillai, J. M., Two *Thousand Years* of *Tamil Literature*:
*An Anthology* with *Studies and Translations*. Madras, Tirunelveli S.I.S.S.
Works Publishing Society, 1959. A compilation of a number of different older
translations of classical Tamil poetry ranging from the
of *Puṟanāṉūṟu*
poems
to Rāmaliṅka Cuvāmikal's verses. The originals are mostly given along with
the translations which are dated and bad in most cases. There are many
footnotes and annotations. Though the translations are antiquated, and
the notes should be read very cautiously, the anthology is useful as a first
introduction to Tamil poetry.

2. Illavazhanar (ed.) and Balakrishna Mudaliar, A. (transl.), The *Golden*
*Anthology of Ancient Tamil* Literature. 3 vols. Madras, Tirunelveli S.I.S.S.
Works Publishing Society, 1959. Includes very unsatisfactory, inexact and
wooden prosaic translations from the Tolkāppiyam, the "Ten Lays", the
"Eight Anthologies", and the "Eighteen Shorter Works", with the original
texts.

3. *Pattuppāṭṭu: Ten Tamil Idylls*. Translated into English Verse with introduction
and notes by J. V. Chelliah. Colombo, General Publishers, 1946.
Valuable. The translations lack true poetic qualities, but are quite reliable
(though not exactly precise); the introductory parts and notes contain much
information which in most cases is quite sound.

4. Kingsbury, Francis, and Phillips, G. E., *Hymns* of the *Tamil Saivite*
*Saints*, Oxford University Press, London, 1921. A valuable selection of the
original texts and very readable translations from Appar, Campantar,
Cuntarar and Māṇikkavācakar.

5. Hooper, J. S. M., Hymns of the Alvars, Association Press, Calcutta, 1929.
 A valuable anthology of the original texts and good translations of the
songs of the Vaṣṇava *bhakta* poets of the 7th - 10th Cent. A.D.

6. Gover, Charles, E., *The* Folk Songs *of Southern India,* 2nd., Tirunelveli
S.I.S.S. Works Publishing Society, Madras, 1959. Contains a number of
Tamil, Kannada, Kodagu etc., folk-songs and poems by "popular" poets in
English translation, with studies and notes which should be taken very
cautiously. In many respects, though, a "classic" of its kind.

### *Studies of Classical Tamil Literature*

1. Aiyar, V. V. S., *Kamba Ramayana*: A *Study.* Bombay, Bharatiya Vidya
Bhavan, 1965. A thought-provoking and sharp study of Kampaṉ's great epic.
Has not lost its attraction even after 40 years (the present book is a reprint).
2. Duraiswami Pillai, A. S., An *Introduction* to *the Study of Tiruvalluvar,*
Madurai, 1961.

3. Jesudasan, C., "Paranar”*, Tamil Culture* III, 3-4 (1954), 268-84.
4. id., "A Study of Kabilar", *Tamil Culture* III, 1 (1954), 18-35.
5. id., *Peaks of Sangam Poetry,* Trivandrum, 1960. Solid and reliable.
6. Kailasapathy, K., *Tamil Heroic Poetry,* Oxford University Press, London,
1968, pp. 282 + xv. So far the best treatment of classical Tamil *puṟam*
poems; against a historical and sociological background; exact, reliable,
thought-provoking; richly documented; contains a wealth of data; Tamil
poetry compared to Greek and Welsh heroic poetry. Lacks structural and
aestetic evaluation of the poetry. Sociological bias. Written in excellent
English. Indispensable for students of Tamil culture.

7. Kanakasabhai, V., The Tamils *Eighteen Hundred Years* Ago. 1st ed.,
Madras, Higginbotham and Co., 1904; 2nd ed., Tirunelveli S.I.S.S. Works
Publishing Society, Madras, 1956. This classic, dated though it is in many
respects, is still worth while reading; it includes a general discussion of
ancient Tamil literature, and the summaries of the "twin epics”.
8. Keller, C. A., "A literary study of the *Tirumurukarruppadai*", *Proceed-*
*ings* of the *I. International Conference* Seminar of Tamil *Studies*, Vol. II,
Kuala Lumpur, 1969, 55-62.

9. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, S., *Manimekhalai in its Historical Setting*,
London, Luzac and Co., 1928. An abridged prose translation of the epic is
included.

with the *akam* genre of classical poetry and in particular with its psychological
and social background.

11. Manuel, M., "The use of literary conventions in Tamil Classical
Poetry", *Proceedings* of the I. *International Conference Seminar of Tamil*
*Studies*, Vol. II, Kuala Lumpur, 1969, 63-69.

12. Marr, John Ralston, *The Eight Tamil Anthologies with special reference*
*to Puṟanāṉūṟu and Patiṟṟuppattu.* Unpublished doctoral dissertation at the
University of London, 1958. An excellent, critical treatment of all aspects of
early Tamil classical poetry, including the prosody.

13. Meenakshisundaran, Pillai T. P., *Collected Papers*, Annamalainagar,
1961.

14. Natarajan, Avvai D., "An Introduction to the Traditional Doctrine
of Love", *Proceedings* of the I. *International* Conference Seminar of *Tamil*
*Studies*, Vol. II, Kuala Lumpur, 1969, 70-87.

15. Nau, Heinrich, *Prolegomena zu Pattanattu Pillaiyars Padal,* Zwickau, 1920. 
Important for its detailed discussion of chronological problems of
Tamil literature.

16. Navaratnam, Ratna, *Tiruvachakam*, the *Hindu Testament of* Love,
Bombay, 1963. Translation and annotations.

17. Pattabiraman, P.Z.-Dessigane, R., *La légende des jeux de Civa à*

20. Schomerus, H. W. *Meister Eckehardt und Manikka-Vasagar,* Guetersloh,
1936, 191 pp. Though both these works are destined rather for the
comparative religionist, they are also important and interesting for the
student of Tamil literature. The first is probably the best treatment of Saiva
Siddhānta philosophy published so far.

21. Singaravelu, S. A., A Comparative *Study of the Story of Rama in South*
*India and Southeast Asia,* Kuala Lumpur, 1966.

22. Srinivasa Iyengar, P. T., *Pre-Aryan Tamil Culture,* Madras, Univ. of
Madras, 1930.

23. Subramania Aiyar, A. V., The *Poetry* and *Philosophy* of the Tamil
*Siddhars*, Tirunelveli, 1957. So far as I know the only treatise on the subject
in English. Therefore important, though unsatisfactory in itself. Too brief;
rather critical.

24. Thani Nayagam, Xavier S., *Nature in Ancient Tamil Poetry*. Tuticorin,
1953. To be recommended. Rather important.

25. Thani Nayagam, Xavier S., *Indian* Thought and Roman Stoicism

thought-provoking.

26. Thani Nayagam, Xavier S., Landscape *and Poetry.* A *Study of Nature*

version of No. 24. Highly recommended.

York: New Directions Publ. Corp., 1965. The two books under 4 and *5*
represent complete prosaic French and English versions of the epic. Good for
reference (though unaccompanied by notes), but as an artistic translation
leaves much to be desired. Frequently imprecise.

6. Dessigane, R. (transl.), *Tirouppavai de Sainte Andal,* Pondichéry, 1952.

*ances*" of *the Tamil Poet*, *Saint and* Sage *Manikka-vacagar*. Oxford: Clarendon
Press, 1900. Though naturally dated in language and style, Pope's
translations are immensely valuable, since they contain detailed introductions,
meticulously prepared texts, a wealth of notes, and concordances,
embodying the rigour and the attentiveness to detail characteristic of 19th
Cent. philological scholarship.

with many notes.

His Five Disciples, London, 1961. Originally published in 1822, and republished
in 1861, 1871 and 1915. Though written by the great C. G. Beschi
