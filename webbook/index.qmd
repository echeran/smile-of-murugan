>|       The great drums beat
>|       As Asura warriors marched.
>|       Their burning rage cut asunder
>|       Corpses scattered
>|       Scorched with a spark
>|       From your radiant smile
>|       O leader of men
>|       With leaf-edged spear
>|       Lover of Vaḷḷi the gypsy
>|       O lord who resides on Tiruttaṇi hills!

Somehow or other, Murugan, the youthful god of victorious war,
is ubiquitous in Tamil writing and culture; he is present in the
earliest classical poems of Tamil as well as in the splendid "Lay of
the Anklet", in the ruby-red and sea-blue and golden songs of
Aruṇakiri as well as in the very recent prayers to Murugan by
A. K. Ramanujan.

His wars are, of course, not only victorious, but just. He destroys
evil, decay, death. His smile is the light of life and eternal youth.
"His face shoots forth myriad rays of light, removing darkness from
the world" (*Tirumurukärruppaṭai* 91-92).
