# THE *CITTAR*: AN ENIGMA

> "They are most popular works in Tamil and \
> there is no pure Tamilian, educated or uneducated, \
> who has not committed to memory \
> at least a few stanzas from one or other of \
> them "(M. S. Purnalingam Pillai). \

Here and there one comes across stray poems in Tamil which
have a number of features in common: a protest, sometimes expressed
in very strong terms, against the formalities of life and
religion; rough handling of priests and Brahmins in general; denial
of the religious practices and beliefs of Brahmanism, and not only
that an opposition against the generally accepted pan-Indian social
doctrine and religious practice; protest against the abuses of templerule;
emphasis on the purity of character; claims made by the
authors of these poems that they have achieved certain psychokinetic
powers and other capabilities which belong to the sphere
of parapsychological phenomena; use of imaginative and ambiguous
language, rather puzzling, though strongly colloquial; no systematic
doctrical exposition. Finally, all these poems are ascribed to a body
of sages known as the *cittar,* the Siddhas.

The writings of the *cittar* belong to the most perplexing and
intricate pages in the history of Tamil literature and culture. It is
a very provocative puzzle; the flashes of exceptional knowledge
and deep wisdom, and the social and philosophical context of the
writings of the *cittar* are so stimulating and exciting that one feels
compelled to investigate the matter and to try to unravel its
mysteries. Besides, some *cittar* poems are truly great poetry.
Who were the *cittar*? What have they written and when did they
write? At present, we are almost unable to answer even these
fundamental questions with any appreciable degree of certainty.
Why should it be so? There are at least three major causes for
this highly unsatisfactory state of affairs. First, nobody has ever
published the writings of the Tamil Siddhas in *toto,* and in a critical
or even a near-to-critical manner. The first modern comprehensive
—but by no means complete-edition of these poems appeared in
1947 and was reprinted in 1956.¹ It is not even an approximation
to a critical edition (though the editor is capable of preparing nearto-critical
editions, as we know e.g. from his excellent edition of
*Iṟaiyaṉār Akapporu!)*; it lacks the *apparatus criticus*, there is no
commentary on the poems, no notes, reading variations are not
given in short, the book is rather a kind of "popular print” serving
as an aid to memory for those who profess devotion to the *cittar*.
We must, nevertheless, be grateful to the editor for having collected
the texts and for having them printed in one handy volume.2
But why this neglect of the writings of the *cittar*? It seems that
the texts have been regarded, by the adherents of the *cittar* move1
*Cittar ňānak* kōvai, edited by Mē. Vi. Vēņukōpālap Pillai, Madras, 1947,
2nd ed. 1956. Another recent edition is Aru. Rāmanātaṇ's *Cittar Pāṭalkaļ,*
Madras, 1959, 2nd 1963, 3rd 1968.

2 The editor admits in the foreword that this is not a critical, but a
"popular" edition. He has, however, appended a Tamil-Tamil glossary of
difficult and unusual terms found in the texts. The edition has 816 pp. It
includes the works of most of the traditionally quoted siddhar, the *cittarka!*
*patineņmār,* "the 18 siddhar", plus the works of Paṭṭiṉattar who is usually
not included among “The Eighteen"; it further contains a number of anonymous
works of similar kind; on the other hand, it does not contain the texts
ascribed to some of the traditionally quoted *cittar* like Pōkanātar, Pōtakuru,
Kōrakkar, Tanvantiri etc.-There had been other editions earlier, e.g. a
fairly comprehensive and good edition by Ramalinga Mudaliyar, *Periya*
*ňāṇak kōvai,* 1899, in 2 vols. The works of individual siddha poets were also
published, cf. e.g. Rajagopala Pillai who in 1915 published a book entitled
*Tiruvenkāṭarennum paṭṭtinattup piḷḷaiyār carittiva purāṇamum*, *tirup-*
*pātarrirattum* (British Museum Libr. 14170. dd. 69). A few years ago I
performed a preliminary and informative digging in the library of the BM in
London; the library contains a large number of manuscripts of *cittar* works.
The Mackenzie Collection (BM 620. g. 34) contains a long list of items connected
directly or indirectly with the Siddhar (e.g. Agastya's "autobiography"
plus a list of 38 works ascribed to him, p. 228, LIII, or, on p. 251,
*Agastya Vyakaraṇa* described as “a short grammar of the Tamil language
attributed to the sage Agastya, but the genuine work is supposed not to be in
existence"). It also seems that Det Kongelike Bibliotek in Copenhagen contains
under Cod. *Tamoul* 10, 39, and 48 some cittar texts (*Rāmatēvar pāțal,*
*Akattiya cuttiram*, and *Cittarpāṭaltiraṭṭu)*. The more interesting and promising
items in the BM may be found under the following numbers: Oriental 1008
Magic, Orient. 1048 Medical, Orient. 5004, Orient. 11726, and especially
Orient. 11727 (Civavākkiyar), Orient. 11729 (Rāmatēvar), Orient. 11736
(Civaväkkiyar), further Or. 11736. 15. A.C. and Or. 11727. 15. A.C. But I am
sure there is much more. The obvious first prerequisite for any further
serious work on the Tamil Siddhars seems to be, therefore, to unearth all
published and especially unpublished (manuscript) texts collected in such
libraries as the BM, Copengahen's Royal Library, Lisabon, the Vatican,
Bibliothèque nationale in Paris, etc., and, second, to prepare an annotated
catalogue of these works. After the texts are gathered and classified, a critical
edition at least of the basic *cittar* works may be contemplated.



ment themselves, as esoteric teaching; hence almost no commentaries,
no expository literature, and no handy editions. On the
other hand, orthodox Hindus in Tamilnad have always had a deeprooted
prejudice against the Siddhas. They tended to ignore them,
even to suppress them; the works of the Siddhas were uncared for,
neglected, and even destroyed.¹
Another reason why the study of this fascinating body of literature
has so far been unsuccessful derives probably from the fact that
it has not been approached and discussed from the right angle:
if mentioned and commented upon at all, this was done in isolation,
and not in the context of very similar or almost identical philosophical,
social and literary movements in other parts of India. The
Siddhas in Tamilnad are certainly not an isolated and unique body
of freethinkers, but part of a very general tradition, well-spread in
space and time in medieval India-the tradition of the *siddhāchār-*
yas, who are, again, part of a larger *āgamic*, tantric and yogic
tradition of India. Any further study of the Tamil *cittar* should
be performed against the background of and in relation to this
pan-Indian *siddhācharya* movement.

Probably the most important reason why Siddhar texts remain
enigmatic to us has already been hinted at. Unlike e.g. the *"Cankam”*
poetry or the Cilappati *kāram,* these texts are fully alive in the sense
that they are until this day used and followed in daily yoga practice;
but unlike the *bhakti* hymns, which are "open" texts, the *cittar* texts
are "closed": their only "true", authentic "esoteric" interpretation
may be revealed by oral instruction, through a *guru*: in other
words, it may be gathered from the *cittar* themselves—and there
are a number of Siddha teachers at large in Tamilnad even today.
I am happy to say that some of my data in this chapter were
graciously supplied by two Siddha yogis in Madras early in 1968.
We do not know when the *cittar* tradition and the *cittar* line
begins in Tamilnad. As an undercurrent, it might have been there
1 Cf. Mā. Campāciva Pillai, *Tirunānmaraivilaka* ārāycci 210:
*camayattai* tāpittu *upakaritta caiva camaya kuravarkal* karpitta *valiyaik*
kaippitittu *olukum caiva makkalum cittar nūlai nōkkavum icaivārā*? *orukālum*
*icaiyār"*. Cf. what Taylor has to say in his catalogue (under *Sivaväkkiyam*):
"I was told some years ago, that the ascetics (Panḍārams) of the Saiva class
seek after copies of this poem with avidity and uniformly destroy every copy
they find. It is by consequence rather scarce and chiefly preserved by native
Christians". Heinrich Nau, in his very interesting *Prolegomena* (Zwickau,
1920), says: . . die Werke der Sidhars (sind) von śivaistischen Zeloten,
besonders den Paṇḍārams, systematisch verfalscht und beseitigt worden".
"
*"caiva*
since very early times. Yoga and tantrism are truly archaic and
pan-Indian. Whenever the 18 *cittar* are enumerated traditionally
in Tamilnad, one begins with Tirumūlar. Tirumūlar is undoubtedly
one of the direct and most influential forerunners of the movement.
At the other end of the line in time stands Tāyumāṉavar (17061744),
a real giant of Tamil religious and philosophical poetry, who
may be considered as a direct descendant of the Tamil *cittar.*
Considering Civaväkkiyar as the earliest of the great genuine
Tamil Siddhas, we shall probably not be far from truth if we say
that the most important exponents of the movement-or, shall we
say, the greatest and most interesting *poets* among the Siddhas?--that
is, Civaväkkiyar, Pattirakiriyar, Pāmpāṭṭi Cittar, Iṭaikkāṭṭuccittar
and Paṭṭiṉattar, flourished between the 10th-15th Cent. A.D.¹
However, a much broader and wider conception of the Siddha
movement in Tamilnad is certainly possible; the only one really
unifying and common element of the *cittar* thus conceived would
be their eclecticism, and their popularity with the masses. If we
stretch our conception of the *cittar* like this, then even the great
Rāmaliṅka Cuvāmi of the 19th Century belongs here (as he actually
claims to),2 and even Subrahmanya Bharati († 1921) who said:
1 Among the *cittar*, we have a few Muslim poets, e.g. Kuṇankuṭimastāṇ,
the obscure mystic, who was under strong influence of sūfism. In Paṭṭinattār's
poems, we find the Telugu pl. suff.-*lu* and some other indications which
seem to point out that the poet belonged to the Vijayanagar period. Some
*cittar* texts mention *intustāni* pāṣai, "the Hindustani language”, and seem
to be actually translations from some North Indian texts (e.g. the prosepassages
a commentary?-of *Civayōkacāram* mention *pañcāpu*, a guru
Caraṇtās, Nānak's disciples, etc.). It is clear that even under a more specific
and narrow conception of the Siddhar movement, we still have to do with
works of very different nature and very different dates. The language of
most of the *cittar* texts is too modern to be older than the 15th cent. A.D. Also,
it is an established usage among the Siddhars to assume the names of the
seers of ancient times. "There is no end to the growth of such apocryphal
works but this does not minimise their greatness and usefulness" (Simon
Casie Chitty, The *Tamil Plutarch*, ed. 1946). Cf. also *L'Inde classique*, II,
163: "Le classement dans ce groupe des Çittar d'auteurs légendaires pêlemêle
avec des personalités qui ont des chances d'être historiques brouille
toute chronologie et oblige pour le moment à rapporter en block au moyen
âge l'élaboration des traités des Çittar, dans lesquels d'ailleurs des additions
trés tardives sont parfois manifestes". An interesting assessment of the
Siddhas may be read in M. Srinivasa Aiyangar's *Tamil Studies* (1914) p. 226:
"Most of them were plagiarists and impostors. . Being eaters of opium
and dwellers in the land of dreams, their conceit knew no bounds". Needless
to say that we do not agree in the least.

2 And, in fact, M. V. Venugopala Pillai has included his *Tiruvaruṭpā*
*tivaṭṭu* into his anthology of *cittar* poetry.



"I am one of the Siddhas of this land!" But this very wide and very
nebulous conception of the *cittar* would not be of much use for our
purposes or for any purposes, in fact.

Traditionally, the Tamil Siddhas trace their origin to Agastya
(Akattiyan), and to various works on mysticism, worship, medicine
and alchemy ascribed to him.¹ In the *Ṛgveda* a brief reference
occurs to Agastya's miraculous birth from a pitcher (*kumbha*), but
otherwise he seems to have been a historical person who composed
hymns, a real Vedic ṛṣi. In the *Mahabharata* we already have a
developed story of Agastya, including his marriage with Lopāmudrā,
a princess of Vidarbha, the motive of the two *daitya* kings and
Agastya's search for wealth, Agastya's drinking up the waters of
the ocean,
,
and his journey to the South when he prevailed upon the
Vindhyas to stop growing until he returned-which, however, he
never did. In the *Rāmāyaṇa,* Agastya figures, too (he fights the
*asuras* and *rākṣasas*). But in the early Tamil works, there is no
reference to Agastya the sage. It is only the *Maṇimēkalai*, a
Buddhist epic, which knows of the miraculous birth of the sage
and his relation to Vasiṣṭha. The first reference to Agastya as the
"Father of Tamil" and the first Tamil grammarian is in Nakkīrar's
commentary to Iṟaiyaṉār's *Akapporu*! (8th Cent.). Later, medieval
commentators, Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar (14th Cent.) and Pērāciriyar
(ca. 1300 A.D.), narrate a number of Agastya-stories and make
him the "Sage of Potiyil". 2 This Agastya, however, whether he
existed or not,³ is a very different person (and legendary hero) from
the Siddha Akattiyar. It is obvious that one or more Siddhas
assumed the name of the ancient, legendary *ṛṣi*, and there exists a
number of works on medicine and alchemy, but also poetic works,
ascribed to an Akattiyar.4
Some of the medical works contain fascinating details. Thus e.g. in
1 *Editio* M. V. Venugopala Pillai contains *Akastiyar ňāṉam* I-IV (pp.
277 ff) and *Akastiyar ňāṉam* V (p. 559).

2 Potiyil is the southernmost mountain of the Western Ghats, the Bettigo
of Ptolemy.

3 Cf. T. P. Meenakshisundaran (ed. The *Tamil Plutarch)*: "Agastya as a
historical figure is no more than a will o' the wisp but as a tradition he
wields an influence which is felt in all walks of Tamilian life".
4 That *this* Agastya was a very late author may be seen from two works
ascribed to him, *Irunurṛaňcu* (a medical treatise) and *Pūraṇacuttiram*
(alchemy) in which he speaks about syphilis as *parankiviyāti* “Frankish
disease", and about quick-silver as *parańki paṣanam* “Frankish remedy”.


Akattiyar's *Kurunāṭiccūttiram*, 1 the author discusses seminal
animalcules, discovered in Western medicine by Ludwig Hamm
in 1677.2 Akattiyar is also said to have performed the trephination
of the skull.

This brings us to a brief discussion of the *cittavaittiyam* or the
system of Siddha medicine in Tamilnad. It belongs here only
marginally, since it is hardly a part of literature in the sense we
are discussing it here. On the other hand, some of the Siddhas were
both poets and physicians, and most if not all of the *cittar* were
vitally interested-as we shall see-in human body and its health.
All of them were undoubtedly yogis.

The medical system claims to be original, not derived from the
Ayurvedic system; contrary to the Ayurveda medicinal practice
which seems to have been concerned primarily with herbs and other
organic drugs, the *cittavaittiyam*-though not adverse to herbsmakes
much use of salts, metals, mineral poisons etc., in short
of elements of anorganic nature. Sometimes it is said that the three
basic methods of Siddha medicine are *maṇi*, *mantiram*, and *maruntu,*
i.e. astrology, reciting mantras and using drugs. However, according
to some more modern exponents of *cittavaittiyam*, the Siddha
therapy consists of 1) yoga *āsanas*, *mudras* and *bandhas* ("locks"),
2) of *cürya cikiccai* or “sun-baths", and 3) of taking drugs (*maruntu)*.
The great Tirumūlar himself spoke about a number of yogic
*āsanas* (*Tirumantiram* 541, 543, 545): he recommends pattiram
("leaf-pose"), *kōmukam* ("cow-pose"), pankayam ("lotus-pose"),
*kecari* ("lion-pose"), *cottiram* (*= svastikāsana*)*, vīram* ("heroic pose”),
*cukātanam* (“easy pose"), and *māmutu* for taking food, further the
kokku ("cock-pose") and one or two other poses. According to later
exponents of Siddha yoga, there are eighteen poses, used in the
therapy (combined with the *bandhas* and *mudras)*.³
1 Cf. Robert's *Oriental Illustrations* of the *Sacred* Scriptures, p. 281.
2 Cf. *English Cyclopaedia, Biography,* vol. III, p. 871. Cf. also W. Taylor,
*Oriental Historical Manuscripts*, in the *Tamil Language*, Vol. I, Madras,
1835, pp. 135, 172, 175, and *Madras Journal* of *Literature and* Science, vol.
IX, p. 161.

3 The eighteen indispensable *āsanas* (Tam. *ācanam*, *ātanam*) are: 1. salutation
(*vanakkam*), 2. sun-worship *(süryanamaskāram*), 3. shoulder integral
pose (*carvānkācaṇam*), 4. fish (*min*), 5. crane (kokku), 6. bow (vil), 7. topsyturvy
pose (*viparītācaṇam*), 8. half-fish (pāti *min*), 9. plough (*kalappai),*
10. serpent (pāmpu), 11. yogic symbol pose (*yōkamutvācanam*), 12. half
wheel (pāti cakkaram), 13. sitting crane (*amarnta* kokku), 14. locust (vițțil),


Breathing is of course a most important part of *citta* yoga. Breath,
*pirāṇam,* is the vital energy, and death, *maraṇam,* is defined by
Rōma Rṣi, one of the classical Siddha therapeutists, as complete
loss of *prāņa: pirāṇan pōyviṭṭa nilai maraṇam.* On various practices
of breathing, the Siddhas based their theory and practice of physical
longevity and even immortality. According to *Rōma riṣi ňāṉam* 13,
a man who is one hundred years old breathes 21,600 times per day.¹
That is, during one hour this healthy centenarian breathes 900 times,
which will give 15 respirations per minute. 2 The span of life is
inversely proportional to the rate of breathing. If the respiration
is 15/min. and the length of life 100 years, then 18/min. gives us
approximately 83 1/3 years. But, the respiration 2/min. gives us
100  15:2 = 750 years, the respiration 1/min. 1500 years,
and if the respiration is o/min., the span of life is 100  15:0 =8,
i.e. infinity. If there is no respiration, leading to stoppage of breath,
as in the so-called *corūpa camāti*, the yogi attains immortality, since
the span of his life is infinity. Practical consequences, appearing
in *citta* yoga therapy: control your breathing; unnecessary talk,
slip-shod panting and gasping, unnecessary respiratory muscle
work is harmful.

Siddha medicine cannot be discussed at length here, since it is
entirely outside the scope of this book, just as the preoccupation
of the Siddhas with *racavātam* or alchemy. As M. Eliade (*Yoga,*
2nd ed., 1969, 281) rightly stresses, in this kind of alchemy we
have no prechemistry, no pre-science, but a spiritual technique,
operating on matter but seeking first to bring about deliverance
and autonomy of spirit. "Gold is immortality" *(amṛtam ayur*
*hiranyam, Maitrāyaṇī Samhitā* II,2,2 and elsewhere)—it is the one
perfect, solar metal, the symbol of spiritual freedom and autonomy.
Alchemy in the Siddha practice has soteriological function. Just as
the *cittar* work on their body, so they also work on matter-to
finish it, to make it mature, perfect, to change it into gold. There
is an occult correspondence between matter and man's psychophysical
body. The vital interest of the *cittar* in medicine and alchemy

is no accident; it is closely connected with their religion and
philosophy, as will be shown later.

Who is a Siddha? A Siddha is one who has attained *siddhi* (Tamil
*citti*), i.e. "power, prowess, strength, ability", then a special kind of
psychic and supernatural, miraculous, occult power. There are
eight kinds of this specific power:
I. *anima* (Skt. *aṇiman*) "shrinking", the faculty of reducing oneself
to the size of an atom;
2. makimā (Skt. *mahiman*) “illimitability", the power of increasing
one's size without limit;
3. *lakimā* (Skt. *laghiman*) "lightness";
4. piratti (Skt. *kāmāvasāyitva*) “fulfillment of desires", the power
of attaining everything desired;
5. *pirakamiyam* (Skt. prākāmya) “irresistible will", the power to
overcome natural objects and go anywhere;
6. *icattuvam* (Skt. isitva) "supremacy", dominion over animate
and inanimate nature;
7. *vacittuvam* (Skt. *vasitva*) "dominion over the elements", the
power of changing the course of nature and assuming any form;
8. *karima* (Skt. *gariman*) "weight", the power of rendering the
body immaterial and able to penetrate matter.

According to *Vāṇmīki cūttira ňāṉam* 3, “by purifying the mind
and attaining perfection one becomes a *cittan*; he is indeed fit to
be called Siva". 1 A classical definition of the Siddhas is given by
the great Tirumūlar: "Those who live in yoga and see the divine
light (oli) and power (*cakti*) through yoga are the *cittar*" (Tiru*mantiram*
1490).

Tirumūlar's *Tirumantiram* is very probably the spring and source
of all *āgamic* texts in Tamil. This is the other stream of religious and
philosophical thought which ran parallel with the bhakti movement,
only it was much less conspicuous and much more "esoteric". The
poet, philosopher and yogi Tirumūlar might have lived sometime
in the 7th Cent. A.D., since he prays to Vināyaka in his invocatory
stanza, and since he is mentioned by Cuntarar in *Tiruttoṇṭattokai*,
st. 5 (7621). The work became part of the Saiva canon (of its 10th
*Tirumuṟai*). In his yogic passages, Tirumūlar is clearly indebted
to Patanjali's *Yogasūtras* and to the *Mandukyopaniṣad*. The

*Tirumantiram* is the greatest treatment of yoga in Tamil literature,
and more than that: the Saiva Siddhānta philosophy as such takes
its origin from this marvellous text. In spite of the simple style, the
text is often obscure, since it uses a wide variety of symbolism,
especially numerical symbolism.¹
*Tirumantiram* contains very many features which are typical
for Siddha writings. Thus it attacks caste-system and the Brahmins,
whom it calls foolish and gluttonous.2 Though the text contains
stanzas which have devotional character (e.g. 712, 1651, 1816, 2104,
2958), much more accent is on yoga and knowledge. The body is
valued as the temple of God, 3 and as a fit instrument for the soul
in its career of self-discipline and search of God (307, 724). Tirumūlar
is sharply opposed to the ultraemotional type of *bhakti*.
God, for him, is "light" and "lustre" *(cōti, cuṭar)*, he is omnipresent,
omnipotent, creator of all, one, the divine potter (*kucavan*), the
divine bull *(nanti*), above all sects, creeds and religious groups.
Like in later Siddhas, and in contrast to bhakti, in *Tirumantiram*
there is total absence of the local cult, of "henolocotheism”, there
are almost no references to the worship of God through *arccanās*
in temples. The Siddhas have not built up a unified system of
philosophy. The same is true of *Tirumantiram*. However, this
collection of more than 3000 quatrains in the *kaliviruttam* metre is
the earliest work in Tamil to contain Śaiva *āgamic* matter, and
though Tirumūlar's thought 4 is not identical with later Saiva
Siddhānta, it is its source, as stressed above.

Tirumūlar was a great poet-philosopher, one of the greatest poets
of symbolism in Tamil literature. For those who follow the Siddha
teachings, he is "the most ancient of the Tamil yoga Siddhas”.
To us, some parts of his *Tirumantiram* are “a masterpiece of mystic
wisdom, robust philosophy and moving poetry”.

In what follows I shall discuss some of the features which are
typical for all or almost all *cittar* as a body of thinkers.
1 Thus e.g. *añcu* "five" may mean, according to context, the five senses, or
the five elements, or the five "sacred" letters, etc.

2 Cf. *Tirumantiram* 231: "The Brahmins. . . are truly without truth and
knowledge, without devotion, they are gluttonous and foolish". Cf. also
onrē *kulamum oruvanē tēvanum* "There is one humanity and one god".
31823: *ullam perunkōyil un* uṭampu *ālayam.*

4 Accord. to A. V. Subramania Aiyar, Tirumūlar was probably an advaitic
vedantin (cf. 116, 1789, 2820), cf. the *pratyabhijňa* school of Kashmir
Saivism. It is believed that he came to Tamilnad from Kashmir.


First, in sharp opposition to the bhakti tradition, they refuse to
allow themselves be carried away by idol-worship in particular
temples. Cf. Civaväkkiyar st. 126*: tēvar kallum āvarō* “Should gods
become stones?” Paṭṭiṉattar in XI,16, sings: "I cannot exalt
the polished stone or the moulded lime or the burnished brass;
it is true that within my heart I have set his two feet similar to
gold... Now I do not need anything more".

The mind, the heart, is the temple of God, and God enters the
heart in a mysterious way, like "coconut water into coconut shell”:
"The Lord came and made a temple of my heart here, entering it in
the same way in which fresh water gets into the reddish young
coconut".

Second, in contrast to bhakti which emphasizes passionate
devotion to God, to the *iṣṭadevatā,* the *cittar* emphasize knowledge
*(ňāṇam*), yoga practice, and character, moral behaviour, right
conduct. Anger (*kōpam)*, lust (*ācai*), egoism (*akaǹkāram*) are the
worst sins. According to Akattiyar 7,1, if the mind is in the right
disposition, it is unnecessary to say prayers.2
Third, almost all Siddhas raise a protest against caste and
casteism. *cāti yāvat(u*) *ēt*(u)*aṭā* “What *is* caste?" asks Civaväkkiyar
in st. 47. And Pattirakiri in his *Lamentations* 126 cries: "O when
will come the day when we shall live without caste-distinctions?"
We are primarily interested in the Siddhas' conception of God,
body and soul, *karma* and reincarnation, since these are the keyproblems
of Indian philosophy. The whole atmosphere of the Siddha
thinking is empirical and experimental. Their writings are not in
the nature of clear-cut formalized statements of any well-defined
doctrine; hence it is difficult to extricate a philosophical system
out of their writings, at least at the present state of our knowledge
of their works; but it is possible to point out a few essential features,
and one day, when their writings are better known, it should be
possible to state their philosophy more explicitly.

There is god, or rather godhead, deity, *civam,* without limitation,
who, by force of sheer custom, carries the name *civan,* Siva (almost
all of them are Saivites but Civaväkkiyar-to quote just one
1 Civaväkkiyar 31: Ceyya tenki *leyilanir cērnta kāra ṇankalpōl* | *aiyaṉ*

example glorifies also Visņu). The *paramātmā* is identical with
*jīvātmā,* with *uyir* "soul, life-force"; and *uyir* does not exist apart
from *uṭal* "body", just as body has no life without uyir. If body is
destroyed, soul, life is destroyed. Hence it is necessary to protect
and cherish the body. There is an important stanza in Tirumūlar
which has become one of the corner-stones of *cittar* thinking:

> If body is destroyed, soul is destroyed; \
> and one will not attain true powerful knowledge. \
> Having acquired the skill to foster the body, \
> I cherished the body, and I fostered the soul. \

Hence the obsession of the Siddhas with the dream of eternal
youth and splendid health; or at least with the possibility to prolong
individual life; and hence the preoccupation with medicine. The
Siddhas professed that there was no incurable disease; and that it
was possible to maintain eternal youth. It was possible, so they
maintained, to get over the five limitations of *narai,* "grey hair",
tirai, "dim vision", muppu, “old age", *nōy,* “disease", and *maraṇam*,
“death”. Rōma Riși says explicitly in *Ṁānam* 12: “If you ask what
is the sign (*ațaiyāļam*) of corūpa *mutti* (= true liberation of body
and spirit), it is the physical body *(tūla* tēkam) aglow with the fire
(of immortality)".

*Karma* and reincarnation are simply and forcefully refuted. God,
"the ancient one", "the omnipotent", "the divine potter", is not
directly engaged in the three actions of creation, preservation and
destruction. Those who actually re-create and procreate, foster,
preserve and destroy the world, including themselves, are men and
women in their actions, one of which, and a very important one,
is the sexual union.

The world is real, not illusory. It exists and endures because of
the ignorance of the soul, of the spirit. *Māyā*, cosmic illusion,
endured by man as long as he is blinded by ignorance, makes
possible the maintenance of the material world. Liberation (*mutti*)
-in contrast to bhakti-is achieved through knowledge; it is a
liberation from the idea of evil and pain. Suffering ceases as soon
as one understands that it is exterior to Self. It is destroyed by
ignoring it as suffering. This true knowledge is obtained in enstasis
*(samādhi*) which is achieved by practice, by physiological yogic
techniques.

Poetry was not the primary concern of the Siddhas. They were
ignorant of, or indifferent to, the complicated poetics of the postTHE
CITTAR: AN ENIGMA

classical age. The rhythm of their stanzas is simple, robust, unrefined,
reminiscent of folk songs. One of them, Pāmpāṭṭi Cittar,
sings verses in the metre used by snake-charmers. Iṭaikkāṭṭu
Cittar sings as if he were a shepherd. They use many colloquial
forms like *añcu* for *aintu* "five", *vaicca* for *vaitta* “placed", enkutu for
*enkiratu* "it says", etc.

They are not free from ambiguous and obscure passages; and
some portions of their works are so obscure that Gover in his wellknown
book Folk-Songs of *Southern* India (1871) suggested that
the obscure chiaroscuro passages are mischievous interpolations
intended to ridicule the *cittar* and weaken their impact on the
people. Indeed a naive and ridiculous statement! Whenever the
Siddhas use ambiguous language, it is on purpose; they are obscure
because they want to be obscure. Their obscure language is an
important device by the means of which they can at the same time
address both a casual listener as well as an adept of greater spiritual
awareness who reads a deep mystic interpretation into their verses.
Thus the dancing *pāmpu* “snake” may be interpreted as one's own
heart or soul; the *akappēy* is the *daimonion* in one's own soul, or
the devil of human mind, etc. In fact, according to the living *cittar*
tradition, the texts are a closed mystic treasure-box bound by
the Lock of ignorance, and only a practising Siddha yogi is able to
unlock the poems and reveal their true meaning.

I will now discuss in some detail two of the Tamil Siddha poets,
Civaväkkiyar and Paṭṭiṉattar. The first because he is typical; the
second, because he is not.

All in all, 527 stanzas are ascribed to Civaväkkiyar, probably
one of the earliest, if not the earliest of the great Tamil Siddha
poets[^earlier-pattinattar]. In some respects, he is the greatest rebel against religious
orthodoxy, sacerdotalism, and the Hindu “establishment".

[^earlier-pattinattar]: The earlier Paṭṭiṉattar of the 10th-11th Century refers to Civaväkkiyar
in his poem *Tiruviṭaimarutur mummaṇikkōvai* 11. 33. A strange story (in
*Kuruparamparā pirapāvam*, *ed.* K. Kiruṣṇamācāriyār, 1909) maintains that
Civaväkkiyar the Siddha converted to Vaiṣṇavism and became one of the
greatest Vaisnava poets under the name Tirumālicai Āḻvār. It is a fact that
his
poems are in *tiruccanta viruttam* metre just like the poems of the Vaiṣṇava
poet; even more curious is the fact that there is a number of stanzas ascribed
to both poets which are nearly identical. Were these two indeed one and the
same person, or did the iconoclastic Saivite cittar copy the Vaiṣṇava mystic?


> "What does it mean - a Paraiya woman? \
> What is it a Brahmin woman? \
> Is there any difference in them \
> in flesh, skin or bones? \
> What is the difference if you sleep \
> with a Paraiya or a Brahmin woman?" \
> (38) \

He also rejects the division between Saivites and Vaiṣṇavites.
Again and again he speaks of Rāma but, at the same time, he
extolls Siva and śaivism.¹ He denounces the Brahminical way of
life, he repudiates the authority of the Vedas and condemns idol
worship in temples.

> "What are temples? What are bathing tanks? \
> Fools who worship in temples and tanks! \
> Temples are in the mind. Tanks are in the mind." \
> (33) \

> "You say that Śiva is in bricks and granite, \
> in the red-rubbed lingam, in copper and brass! \
> If you could learn to know yourself first, \
> the God in temple will dance and sing within you!" \
> (34) \

Recalling the scheme S₁ S₂ O₁ O2 which we used when structurally
analysing bhakti hymns, we observe in the poetry of the Siddhas
complete negation of O2. One cannot say at all what is God, how
he is. God is described almost exclusively in negative terms, in
what he is not. This is in sharp contrast with the bhakti conception
of a personal, individualized God having so many attributes and
residing in a particular form in a particular shrine.

> "The lazy ones say: Far away, far away, far away (is God). \
> The *paraparam* (Supreme Being) is spread everywhere on earth and \
> in the skies. \
> O you poor dumb ones, running through towns and country and \
> jungles, suffering in search, \
> Know well that Godhead is right there within you, and stand still!" \
> (14) \

Observe how he describes God: ap *parāparam* "that supreme
thing", spread everywhere (*enkumāy paranta)*, and being within men
*(ummul*). In another stanza, Civaväkkiyar identifies *civam*, the
Absolute, with *aṟivu*, knowledge. This is, of course, nothing new;
again we may point back to Tirumūlar who says "Those who say
that knowledge and *civam* are two (different) things, are ignorant”.


This *aṟivu* or *ňāṉam* ¹ is naturally not the discursive kind of knowledge
found in the texts:

> "O you who proclaim yourselves the yogis of knowledge, \
> who search after knowledge in books! \
> You do not know your own hearts - \
> there you should search after the light of knowledge! \
> Knowing the unique Lord who is knowledge, \
> there is nothing else than the truth we proclaimed!" \
> (453) \

Elsewhere Civaväkkiyar speaks of those who drag the burden
of books and blabber lies. True knowledge empirical and experimental.
One of the most powerful stanzas of all his poems is the one in
which he plainly refutes the theory of transmigration; it deserves
to be quoted fully:

> *karanta* pāl *mulaippukā kaṭainta veņṇey mōrpukā* \
> *uțaintu pōna cankinōcai yuyirkalum uṭarpukā* \
> *virintapu vutirnta kāyum mīṇṭu* pōy *marampukā* \
> *irantavar* pirappa *tillai yillaiyillai yillaiye* \
> (46)

1 *entai* rāma *rāma rāma rāmavenrum* nāmame, st. 10; civayam *enra āṭcă-*
ram civan irukkum *āṭcāram*.


> "Milk does not return to the udder, nor butter to butter-milk. \
> Nor the life within the sea-shell, when it breaks, to its body. \
> The blown flower, the fallen fruit do not return to the tree. \
> The dead are not born, never, never, never!" \

Civaväkkiyar also ridicules many ritual and social customs
and practices: thus e.g. saliva, which is considered by the Hindus
as something utterly unclean, he refuses to regard as unclean in
itself. In st. 479 he says: "Why should you be so fussy about *eccil,*
about saliva? Why-honey is the bee's saliva; the beetle's spittle
is on the flower, the cow's milk itself is mixed with the saliva of
the calf". And he laughs at those who bathe for cleanliness' sake
and yet are impure in their hearts (cf. stanzas 207, 209 etc.).
Civavākkiyar's poetry shows that there had been a school of
thought in Tamilnad that repudiated caste and stood for absolute
equality of all in the religious and social practices. His great contribution
to Tamil literature lies in the fact that he has used,
1 A rather late highly philosophical Siddha text *(Civāṇanta põtam*) is a
dispute in dialogue form between *maṇam* “mind” and *aṟivu* “knowledge,
wisdom". The interesting thing is that the ignorant mind speaks in prose,
whereas the supreme knowledge speaks in verse.

2 *vaicca veccil* ten alō *vanti* neccil *pūvalō* | *kaiccu tavil vaittutan karanta*
palum eccile.



probably for the first time in Tamil writing, the common idiom of
the people, both in syntax and lexis. On the whole, he is a powerful,
independent, crude and often striking poet, who is definitely worth
reading.

In the concluding remark on Civaväkkiyar I cannot abstain from
quoting one of his stanzas which illustrates the “purposeful obscurity"
of the *cittar* diction (st. 221):

> *akāra* kāra *ṇattilē yanēka nēka rūpamāy* \
> *ukāra kāra ṇattilē yurutta* rittu *ninranan* \
> *makāra kāra ṇattilē mayankukira vaiyakam* \
> cikāra kāra *ṇattilē teļinta* tēci *vāyamē* \

> "Like so many forms he stands through the sound *a,* \
> having dressed himself in shapes through the sound *u*, \
> the world confused - through the sound *ma*; \
> it became clear as *civāyam* - through the sound *ci*." \

This may indeed seem “closed by the lock of ignorance”. However:
the sound a (*akāram*) is the symbol of beginning, and of the
Primeval Lord (cf. Pāmpāṭṭi Cittar 5: āti *tēvaṇ,* also *Tirukkuṟaḷ*
1) who is eternal and omnipresent, in many forms; the sound *u*
stands for *uru*, *uruvu* which means “shape, form”, i.e. material
shapes; the sound *ma* symbolizes *mayakkam* “bewilderment, confusion",
also *māyā* "illusion of creation" (so important in yoga
philosophy); and *ci* is of course the first syllable of *civāyam*, i.e.
*namacivāyam*, the sacred "five letters", the mystic formula of
Saivism and Siddhism. In other words, the quatrain contains a
whole theology: God is the eternal and omnipresent Lord, clad
in material forms, dispelling the confusion and ignorance of the
world by the mystic doctrine of *namacivāyam*. Schematically:
*a*
*U*
*m(a*)
*ci*
=====
Supreme God
in many material forms
in real world existing because of ignorance
removed by the doctrine and practice of
*civāyam*
Reading the first "letters" of the quatrain vertically, we get the
greatest and the most potent *mantra*: *a* + u + m + *ci*:
i.e. ōm ci(*vāyanama*).

aum,
The greatest *poet* among the Tamil Siddhas is undoubtedly
Pațțiṇattār. It is very probable that at least two poets hide under


1
this name, an earlier one (10th-11th Cent. A.D.), whose five poems
were included into the 11th book of the Saivite canon (*Tirumurai*),
and a later one, the true *cittar,* probably of the Vijayanagara period,
of the 14th Cent. A.D. The earlier Paṭṭiṉattar is a Śaiva *Nāyaṉmār,*
a bhakti poet writing in grand style of literary Tamil a poetry of
charming descriptions and captivating similes, but, at the same
time, picturing the ephemeral nature of physical pleasures and
human sufferings in very dark colours (and this he has in common
with the later Paṭṭiṉattar).

However, here we are not concerned with the poems of this
earlier Paṭṭiṉattar. We shall discuss Paṭṭiṉattar the Great,
Paṭṭiṉattar the Siddha, the author of the 632 stanzas and 207 lines
going under the name *Pattinattar Pātal,* a poet who probably
belonged to the 14th-15th Cent. A.D. Together with Tāyumāṉavar
and Rāmaliṅka Cuvāmi, he is the most popular religious poet of
South Indian Saivism. In this great poet, we have a yogic ascetic,
a man of revolt against Brahmanic and ritualistic social order, as
well as a saint with mellowed and sublimated outlook, a bard
singing of sadness in this world, but also accepting this world with
almost cheerful resignation.

The very first lines of his songs sound like blows of a hammer:

> *pirantana* irakkum *irantana* pirakkum \
> tōnrina *maraiyum maraintana tōnrum* \
> *punarntana piriyum pirintana puṇarum*... \
> *uvappana* veruppam veruppana *vuvappam* etc. \
> 
> Those who are born, die; the dead are born; \
> those that appear, disappear; those who vanish, appear; \
> who join, separate; those that separate, join. \
> Joys become hateful; hatreds become joys \

Paṭṭiṉattar, in most of his poems, is the great relativist and the
great pessimist of Tamil literature. Life is a tragedy, an eternal
interplay of contradictions and antinomies, a lie, "a tale told by
an idiot".

> "Uttering lies so much that your tongue cracks \
> Hoarding riches and wealth \
> You lie with women who know no good \
> And bring forth children \
> So rapidly, so readily \
> Like the poor white ants that come out when earth cracks! \
> You do not know how to foster them. \
> You will not forsake them. \
> You have put your foot into a hole \
> in the bole of a tree. \
> Like the monkey that removed the wedge \
> You are caught to stay and suffer, \
> You are caught, \
> You!" \
> (XI. 65) \

His language is cruel, fierce and direct in his treatment of woman
as the seat of filth and temptation, and of man as the seat of
vileness and egoism.

> "I loved this mortal vessel stuffed with blabbering air, \
> this leather bag for rice, this torn sack wrapped in flesh, \
> this stinking body, cow-stable of lust, \
> and roamed about and begged, \
> o Ēkampan of Kāňci, Lord!” \
> (II. 27) \

> "The fire says: It is mine. But the worm, too, says: It's mine. \
> And this earth says: Well, it's mine. But the kite says: \
> It is mine. And the jackal says It's mine \
> And wants to devour it. And the mean dog says: It's for me! \
> This stinking body I cherished with love. \
> And what was the use?' \
> (XI. 26) \

> "The treasury of insolence; the granary of anger; \
> the palace from which ignorance does not depart; \
> the home of falsehood, this rag of a body, \
> full of lust and flirting, its towering weapon \
> swelling into skies! \
> How to attain wisdom \
> in worshipping you?" \
> (XI. 55) \

Woman's beauty is to him the most detestable thing on earth.
In seventy lines he strips woman totally of her glamour. "I shall
now teach something all those men / who have been enjoying
and loving and taking women in lust!" And he describes the female
body as a bag of filth. The belly, compared by poets to a banian
leaf, is a shaking screen of dirt and dregs; the breasts, compared
to lotus-buds, are in fact two hanging dried-up pouches, parched
and full of inner heat, scratched by the finger-nails of lusty men.
The neck is full of sweat and dust and filth, and out of the hellish


mouth spurts poison. And so on and so forth. As we see, there is a
very notable difference between Paṭṭiṉattar and the early *cittar*:
they liked their own body, they wanted to cherish and foster and
preserve it, in order to use it for yogic techniques. Paṭṭiṉattar, in this
respect, is actually more of a 'classical' yogi than a Siddha: according
to Patanjali (*Yogasūtras* II.40), physical purification produces
disgust with one's own body, and cessation of contact with other
bodies a point in which "classical" yoga and the "magical", Siddha
yoga differ significantly.

While the early *cittar* are full of confidence and self-respect,
Paṭṭiṉattar and his disciple, the poet Pattirakiriyar (Bhadragiri,
who composed the heart-rending *Moaning* cry of *true wisdom*,
*Meyňňānappulampal*) show a kind of spiritual frustration, a
passionate longing for peace, even in death, for deliverance, for
liberation. Their songs are pathetic outcries ending with passionate
wails; personal God returns, not to the extent we know in classical
bhakti, but indicating that we are on the road to Tāyumāṉavar
and Rāmaliṅkar. In Paṭṭinattār's and Pattirakiriyar's writings
there is almost no trace of that self-confidence, of the proud and
sure knowledge of a Tirumūlar or Civaväkkiyar. Listen to Paṭṭiṉattar
XV.1: *mūlam ariyēn muțiyu muṭivariyēn* "I do not know the
beginning, I do not know the ultimate end..." Or XV.5: "The earth
devoured me who desired earth, and the desire of gold and women
*(ponnācai penṇācai*) do not want to leave me!" XV.13: "Fear and
egoism refuse to go". The notion of sin, the feeling of shame, of
self-humiliation--these are new and unheard of notes in *cittar*
creations.

In Paṭṭiṉattar, there is almost always a mixture of cynicism and
pathetic helplessness; of vile abuse-abuse of self, of women, of
the sinners and moving appeal. He has composed a number of
beggary stanzas, too, with a particular charm of their own.

> "For the cool mist \
> there are tight rags. \
> There's rice in every house, \
> just beg and eat. \
> And when you are aroused, \
> there are fine harlots roaming in the street. \
> Why then grow weary of this world? \
> O heart! To be so sore each day!" \
> (XI. 15) \

There are hardly more moving “beggary stanzas” in Tamil
literature than the following:


> "When cold wind blows \
> and the sun is gone, \
> there is an old abandoned dressjust \
> take it \
> and cover your body. \
> All the world over \
> there's everywhere an outside porch \
> to lie down and to sleep. \
> When hunger comes, \
> there's Śiva to give. \
> O heart! \
> There's indeed nothing which we lack!" \


The *cittar* tradition—especially the Siddha *vaidya,* the Siddha
medicine is fully alive. So are most of the *cittar* songs. One can
hear them sung often by wandering religious mendicants. "To
denounce today caste, worship in temples and religious and āgamic
rituals does not require much courage, but to have done so in the
centuries in which the Tamil Siddhars lived required extraordinary
heroism and strength of conviction". 1 A knowledge of the works
of the *cittar* is absolutely necessary to have a correct perspective
of the civilization of the Tamils, of their religious, social and literary
history.
