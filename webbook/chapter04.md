# THE CAṄKAM LEGEND. THE TEXTS

In the following chapters we shall mostly deal with the anatomy
of the earliest Tamil bardic poetry, selected specimen of the two
main genres, *akam* and *puṟam,* will be analysed, the thought-content
and the form of these poems will be described; as well as their
language and structure, the themes and cycles, the formulae, the
metre and prosody, in short, the thematic and psychological as well
as the formal aspects of these compositions. We shall also deal with
the theory of poetics evolved by Tamil scholiasts approximately in
the middle of the 1st millennium A.D.

First, however, we shall discuss some other questions pertinent
to this early literature: above all, the term and the notion of *Caṅkam*
and *Caṅkam literature*, the legend of the *Caṅkam,* and the *rationale*
behind this legend. Second, we must give a detailed account of
various anthologies out of which we shall select our examples for
analysis.

4.1. *Caṅkam* (pronounce *Sangam*). We hear this term again and
again. Not only that it is current as the attribute of the literature
of the earliest period-in most books and papers dealing with
Tamil literature one encounters the term *Caṅkam* poetry or *caṅka*
*ilakkiyam* on every page—but also it is used as an attribute of other
phenomena, like language (*cańkattamil*), or even the whole epoch
which is called the "Sangam Age". The term *Caṅkam* poetry or
*Caṅkam* literature or even *Caṅkam* Age means that, according to a
persistent indigenous tradition, a *literary caṅkam* or *Academy* in
*Maturai* shaped and controlled the literary, academic, cultural and
linguistic life of ancient Tamilnad.

The legend about a learned body responsible for and critically
controlling the literary output of early Tamil poets is rather late:
it seems to occur for the first time in a line by Appar who uses the
term *caṅkam*[^appar-cankam] in *Tirupputtür Tāṇṭakam*, st. 3, i.e. in the 7th Cent.

[^appar-cankam]: *nan pattup* *pulavaṇāyc caṅkam ēri* / *narkanakak kilitarumikku aruļinōn*
*kaṇ* "Look at Him who was gracious enough to appear in the assembly
*(cankam*) as a poet of fine poems and presented the purse of gold to Tarumi".
For further references to Sangam, and to Maturai as the seat of Tamil
learning, cf. Tiruvātavūrār: *kūṭalin aynta ontintamil;* Cēkkiḻār: *talaiccanka*
*pulavaṇār tammun*; Āṇṭāļ: *cankattamiļ mālai* muppatum; Auvaiyār: *cankat-*
*tamiḻ munṛun* tā; Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār: *caṅka mukattamil*; Kampar: ten *tamiḻ*
*nāṭṭakal potiyil tirumunivan tamilc caṅkam cērkirpīvēl;* Pēraciriyar's comm.
on *Tolk. Marapu*: *mūnru vakaiccańkattu nānku varuṇat toṭupaṭṭa cānrōrum.*
Etc. I suspect one may quote from later literature *ad nauseam*.

It has been fully developed in the commentary by Nakkīrar (ca
650-750 A.D.) to *Iṟaiyaṉār Akapporuḷ.*[^iraiyanar-akapporul] It was much later repeated
and even more evolved in Perumparrap Puliyūr Nampi's *Tiruvilai-*
*yāṭalpurāṇam*, 15 (12th Cent. A.D.).

cf. T. G. Aravamuthan, "The Oldest Account of the Tamil Academies"*, JORM*
1930, 183-201 and 289-317, and K. V. Zvelebil, "The Earliest Account of the
Tamil Academies", IIJ (forthcoming, 1973). From this account it may be
seen 1) that by the time Nakkīrar wrote his commentary, the anthologization
of the collections (including the rather late *paripāṭal* and *Kalittokai*) must
have been already a *fait* accompli; on the other hand, this account does *not*
mention either the (*Eṭṭut*) tokai or the (*Pattup*)*pāṭṭu* arrangement as such
(nor, as a matter of fact, any of the pāṭṭu
"lays"); 2) it mentions, for the
first time, the *Tolkāppiyam* as
a *single grammatical* work; 3) the language of
this account shows that its author was
definitely *not* identical with any of the
older Nakkīrars; there are some
rather late forms which indicate that this
commentary may be as late as the 8.-9.
Century (*avarkalāl pāṭappaṭṭana,*
*avarkalai,* kavi, etc.). \
 \
 Appar seems to be the first (in terms of time) to have used the term
*caṅkam* in the sense we discuss it here
. Or, probably, it was Nakkīrar in his
commentary. Previous to this, there
are a few lines in the old, "Sangam"
texts, which might be interpreted
as referring to a body of poets and/or
scholiasts and critics; however, this
conclusion is purely speculative. The
lines I have in mind are
Maturaikkāňci 761-763: *tollāṇai nallāciriyar |*
*punarkut* tunța pukalcāl ciṟappin *nilantaru *
*tiruvin* nețiyon pōla. In the
*Payiram* to Tolk., we read
*nilantaru tiruvil pāṇṭiyan avaiyattu*, where *avai,*
with a rather "long" stretch of
imagination (it is of course a loanword
\< Skt. *sabhā-*) may be interpreted as
*caṅkam.* Even in the very early texts,
though, Maturai is connected specifically
with Tamil, cf. Puṟ. 32.5 *tentamil*
*nannāṭṭut* titutir *maturai* and ib.
58.13 tamiḻ kelu *kūṭal*, *Kalitt*. *niņmāṭak*
*kūtalar* pulan *nävil* piranta col,
Cirupan. 66-67 *tamiḻ nilaiperra tänkaru*
marapin / *makilnanai marukin *
*maturai.* The *Cinnamanur* (1. 29) plate says:
*makāpāratam tamilppatuttum maturāpuric *
*caṅkam vaittum*.

According to Nakkīrar's account, there were three "academies"
*(talaiccankam*, *iṭaiccankam*, *kaṭaiccaṅkam*). The first
Sangam, whose
seat was Southern Maturai, now submerged
into the sea (*kațal*
*kollappatta maturai*), lasted 4440 years, and 4449
poets took part in
it; the members included gods and sages:
Śiva, Muruka, Kubera, and
Agastya. Its grammar was *Akattiyam (avarkku *
*nūl akattiyam).*

The second Sangam, situated in *Kapāṭapuram* (cf. Vālmīki's
*Rāmāyaṇa, Kişk*. 42: 13), also submerged
in the sea, lasted for
3700 years and included 3700 poets; it had
five grammars as
norms, among others *Akattiyam* and *Tolkāppiyam*.

The third Sangam, situated in today's Maturai (*Uttara* or Upper
Maturai) lasted for 1850 years under 49 kings
beginning with the
Lame Tiru Māraṇ (Muṭattirumāṛaṇ) and
ending with Ukkiraperuvaluti;
its 449 poets formed a body presided
by Nakkīrar. The two
normative grammars of this Academy were
*Akattiyam* and *Tolkāppiyam.*

It is indeed difficult to say whether there is a *rationale* behind
this rather late legend. It is of course not
improbable that at the
end of the classical epoch, when the early bardic
poetry became
slowly a matter of a classical past and ceased
to be part of a live
oral tradition, there existed a body of
scholiasts and grammarians
who used to decide whether a poem should be acknowledged as part
of the classical heritage, written down, preserved and become part
of the process of anthologization and codification. However: The
earliest, pre-Pallava corpus of Tamil literature itself maintains a
complete silence about any such body, though Maturai and Tamil
literature are specifically connected (cf. e.g. *Puṟ*. 58). The earliest
Pandya inscriptions do not know anything about any Sangam in
Maturai. Though an *argumentum ex silentio,* it is still pretty damaging,
according to my opinion. On the other hand, there are some
indications which show that there probably was a rational kernel to
the legend; first, some of the names of the kings and poets mentioned
in the legend are found in inscriptions and other authentic records
(e.g. the poet Perunkunṛūr Kiḻār). Second, and this is very interesting,
according to Nakkīrar, the number of poets of the 3rd Sangam
was 449. Now, according to an edition of the early texts known as
*Canka Ilakkiyam (Samājam,* 1940), the total number of poets was
473 (+ 88 anonymous); but this number includes 35 poets named
after some significant expression in their poems; if we disregard
these 35 we get the number 438, and these two numbers, the
*Samājam* total (which must, at the present stage of our knowledge,
be taken anyhow as an approximation) and Nakkīrar's traditional
number, come rather near. Or, one may take[^vaiyapuri-pillai] the *Samājam*
total (473) minus the authors of the later portions and poems, the
*paripāṭal, Kalittokai*, *Murukārṛuppaṭai* and the invocatory stanzas
by Peruntēvaṇār, and arrive at 459, which is still nearer to the
traditional 449.

It seems that in 470 A.D., a *Drāviḍa Sangha* was established in
Maturai by a Jain named Vajranandi (the Prakrit term used is
*daviḍa-sangho).* It seems that this Jaina organisation took (among
other activities) a great interest in the Tamil language and literature.[^kararese-sangam-date]
It is also true that, among the earliest poets, there occur Jain

[^vaiyapuri-pillai]: Cf. S. Vaiyapuri Pillai, *HTLL*, 38-39.

[^kararese-sangam-date]: Cf. E. P. Rice, *A History* of *Kararese Literature*, 2nd. ed., 1921, pp. 26-27:
"*Pujyapāda,* also called Devanandi, belongs to the sixth or seventh century
One of his disciples, Vajrānandi, is said to have founded a Tamil sangha
in Madura". This does not say much. More important is the account given by
Prof. Peterson in *Journ*. *Bombay Branch* of RAS, Extra Number to Vol. 17
(1887-1889), p. 74, in A Second Report of *Operations* in Search of *Sanskrit*
*MSS*. in the *Bombay* Circle, April 1883-March 1884: "In a Digambara
Darśanasâra, lately obtained from Anhilwâd Pâțhan, Devasena, who gives
his own date as 909, (apparently, from his constant use of that era, Samvat
909 = A.D. 853), tells us that Vajranandi, the pupil of Sri Pujyapâda,
founded the Draviḍa Samgha in Matura of the Deccan in the year 525
"after the death of Vikrama". I give the two passages: (1) siripuṁjja
pădasīso dāviḍasaṁghassa kāragovuttho ṇāmeṇa vajjaṇaṁdī pāhuḍavedī
mahasattho // paṁcasae chavise vikkamarāyassa maraṇapattassa / dakkhiņa
mahurājādo dāviḍasaṁgho mahāmoho //".

names (such as Ulōccaṇār, Mātīrttan etc.), that Jaina cosmology and
mythology is mentioned in the early corpus (e.g. *Puṟ*. 175, *Akam*
59), as well as Jain austerities *(Akam* 193), that Tolkāppiyaṉār very
probably was a Jain, too. The Cinnamanur plates (10th Cent. A.D.)
mention a Sangam at Maturai. All this seems to indicate that the
cultural prestige of Maturai, the uniformity and fixity of the style
and language of the earliest poetry, and the lively interest the Jains
and their organisations always took in the Tamil language and
culture, provided some basic rational elements for the “Legend of
the Sangam". For the Jain character of the Sangam-and, at the
same time, for the purely fictitious number of years traditionally
given there is one more evidence: observe that the number of
years given is always a multiple of 37: 37 by 120, 37 by 100, 37 by 50.
The typical passion of the Jains for numbers is well-known.[^jain-numbers]

[^jain-numbers]: Cf. X. S. Thani Nayagam, *Ancient Tamil Poetry* (xeroxed), 1964, p. 7.

In conclusion one may agree with what K. A. Nilakanta Sastri
says in his *A History of South* India, 3rd. ed., p. 116: "That a college
*(cankam*) of Tamil poets flourished for a time under royal patronage
in Madura may well be a fact... Some of the names of the kings and
poets are found in inscriptions and other authentic records, showing
that some facts have got mixed up with much fiction, so that no
conclusions of value can be based on it".

4.2. *Caṅkam literature*: The term, strictly speaking, should not be
used. The Jesudasans are right when they say *(A History* of *Tamil*
*literature*, 8); "The title 'the Sangam Period' is misleading". And
they admit that it is a name given only for the sake of convenience.
Even worse is the term "Augustan" or "Augustus" era of literature
(which, if I am not mistaken, was introduced by S. Krishnaswami
Iyengar in *Tamil Antiquary,* No. 5, 1909).

If there is at all an appropriate term for this corpus of conventional
literature, it is the term "Classical". First of all, the so-called
*Caṅkam* poetry is regarded by the Tamils themselves, by the
professional historiographers and critics, as well as by intellectual
readers, as classical, in the same sense in which we regard some parts
of our national literatures as classical. Second, it has been, since
probably the 5th-7th Cent. A.D., a finite, “frozen" corpus, a body
of texts which had not been expanded since it ceased to be part of a
live oral tradition. Since those times, it has become a part of the
"classical" heritage as were. Third, it is the expression of a
linguistic, prosodic and stylistic perfection; it is a finished, consummate
and inimitable literary expression of an entire culture, and
of the best in that culture; in this sense, it is truly a "classical"
product, a classical literature.

4.3. At this point we shall give at least the most basic data
concerning the fifteen texts which form the earliest literary corpus
in Tamil. Without the knowledge of this basic information which
includes the name of the anthology or poem, the number of stanzas
or lines included, the name of the compiler, of the commentator(s),
of the editor and a brief characterization of the text, any further
discussion is meaningless. Sometimes these facts are by themselves
rather revealing. The various anthologies and poems will be described
here in chronological order.

I. *Ainkuṟunūṟu*

Traditionally the third among the anthologies. "(The collection of)
five hundred short (poems)". It owes its name to the fact that it is
divided into five groups of 100 short stanzas each, each group being
concerned with one of the five basic "physiographic regions"
(*aintinai*) in the following order: *marutam* “riverine”, *neytal* “littoral",
kuṟiňci "montane”, *pālai* “arid" and *mullai* "pastoral". Each
hundred is subdivided into tens or *pattu.*[^patirrupattu] The poems have three to
six lines each. Stanzas 129 and 130 are not extant. Five poets are
credited with the authorship of the work: the centum on *marutam*
was composed by Ōrampōki, on *neytal* by Ammūvaṇār, on *kuṟiňci*
by Kapilar the Elder, on *pālai* by Ōtalāntai, on *mullai* by Pēyaṇ.
Peruntēvaṇār composed an invocatory song. The anthology is said
to have been made by Pulatturai Murriya Kūṭalūr Kiḻār on the
direction of *a Cēral* king Yāṇaikkaṭ Cēy Māntaraň Cēral Irumpoṟai.
The anonymous old commentary on this anthology is not a detailed
one, but it is supplemented by a detailed commentary by U. V.
Swaminatha Aiyar. A few lines of Aink. appear in paripāṭal*, Ci-*
*lappatikāram, Nālaṭiyār* and other later works. There are not many
Indo-Aryan loanwords in the text. In *Aiṅk*. 202 we hear (probably
for the first time in Tamil texts) about the *kuțumi* “pig-tail” of
Brahmin boys (*pārppaṇak kuṛumaka kuțumit talai*). There are
17 allusions to historical incidents in this anthology. The work was
first published in 1903 by U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar. There is a good
edition in 3 vol. prepared by Auvai S. Turaicāmi Pillai, publ. by the
Annamalai University (1938).

[^patirrupattu]: The arrangement into tens is found also in *Patiṟṟuppattu* "Ten Tens",
and the traditions of tens continues all through the history of Tamil literature
in the *Tirukkuṟaḷ*, in the *bhakti* poetry, etc.; it may be of Sanskritic
origin, cf. the *śataka* arrangement. The tens in *Ainkuṟunūṟu* are named after
the word or line repeated in each of the ten verses; such poems with recurring
lines and phrases show the underlying bardic tradition.



2. *Kuṟuntokai*,

"The collection of short (poems)". Under the original scheme, the
collection must have had 400 stanzas, though U. V. Swaminatha
Aiyar's edition has 401 stanzas including the invocatory stanza by
Peruntēvaṇār. It includes *akam* songs by 205 bards. 398 stanzas are
indeed *kuru,* "short", i.e. from 4 to lines. Poems 307 and 391 have
9 lines (and may have been “smuggled into it by careless copyists",
N. Subrahmanian, *Pre*-*Pallavan Tamil Index*, p. 6). The compiler
was a certain Pūrikkō (a king?) of whom we know nothing else. The
colophon is silent about the patron who directed the compilation.
Tradition says that Pērāciriyar had written a commentary on all
but 20 stanzas of this collection, and that another complete commentary
was composed by Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar. Neither is extant now.
U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar has published the text in 1937 with a fine
and detailed commentary of his own. About 10 phrases occurring
in *Kuṟuntokai* poems appear in later works, like the *Tirukkuṟaḷ*
and *Cilappatikāram.* There are some interesting Skt. loanwords like
*amiltam* (83, 201), *yāmam* (5), *āttirai* < *yāttirai* (293). About 30
poets have Aryan names (Uruttiran, Tēvakulattār etc.). T. S.
Arangasami Ayyangar published *Kuṟuntokai* in 1915 for the first
time. *Kuṟuntokai* contains *27* historical allusions.

3. *Naṟṟiṇai*

is mentioned traditionally as the first among the eight collections.
The name means "(The collection of poems) on excellent tiņais” or
"(The collection) of excellent (poems) on the *tiṇais*". The anthology
contains 400 songs ranging from 8 to 13 lines. In the extant form,
song 234 is missing (a poem quoted as an illustration by the scholiast
on *Iṟaiyaṉār Akapporuḷ* has been included in the 2nd ed. as the
missing song 394), and poem 395 is fragmentary. The anthology
was made under the patronage of the Pandya king Paṇṇāṭu tanta
Pāṇṭiyaṉ Māran Valuti, but the compiler is anonymous. (The king
was also the author of *Nar*. 97 and 301, and of *Kur*. 270.) There is a
good commentary by P. A. Narayanaswami Aiyar. No ancient
commentary is available. The anthology was published in 1914. It
contains 59 historical allusions. Quite a number of lines or phrases
reappear in *Tirukkuṟaḷ.* A few lines are found in *Puṟam* and *Akam*
(e.g. 175), and are later quoted in *Cilappatikāram* and *Maṇimēkalai.*
The allusion to the legend of a woman who tore off her breast
(Kaņṇaki?) occurs in *Nar*. 312. There are not many Indo-Aryan
loanwords in the poems of *Naṟṟiṇai.*

4. *Patiṟṟuppattu*

or "Ten Tens" is a collection of panegyric poems, consisting of ten
sections; each ten has been sung by a poet or poetess in praise of a
Chera king; each poem is supplemented by an unusually informative
colophon, partly in verse and partly in prose. It is therefore a
chronicle in verse, devoted exclusively to the *Cērals*, the ancient
rulers of Kerala. Two decades, the first and the tenth, are lost. 39
lines of this work are found in the commentary to *Tolk*. (4 stanzas)
and in *Purattiraṭṭu,* a later anthology of war-poetry.

The epilogues or patikams furnish us with details about the
author, the hero, his lineage, etc.; they are most probably of later
times (possibly added by the compiler), but they seem to have
drawn on relatively dependable historical materials. Both the
poems and the epilogues provide abundant sources of sociological
interest (J. R. Marr, op. *cit*. 283, 328). Stylistically the poems are
similar to the rest of the poetry in *akaval* (Kailasapathy, *op. cit*. 29),
but a few peculiar regional expressions and usages do occur (M. A.
Thiagarajah, *The Cēranāțu during the Caṅkam and* the Post*-Cankam*
*Period,* pp. 222 ff.). The II. decade by Kumaṭṭūrk Kaṇṇaṉār, a
Brahmin poet, is in praise of Imayavarampaṉ Nețuňcēral Ātan (the
son of Utiyaṉ Cēral and the father of the great Cenkuṭṭuvan). This
king is said to have beaten the Aryas and the Yavanas, and carved
a bow-emblem on the Himalayas.

The III. decade, by a Brahmin poet Pālaik Kautamaṇār, is
dedicated to the younger brother of Imayavarampaṉ, king Palyānaic
Celkeļu Kuṭṭuvaṉ.

The IV. decade by Kāppiyarruk Kāppiyaṇār is in praise of
Kalankakkaṇṇi Nārmuțic Cēral, one of the sons of Imayavarampaṉ.

The V. decade, ascribed to the great Paraṇar, sings of the mighty
Cenkuṭṭuvan, son of Imayavarampaṉ, and contemporary of
Gajabāhu I of Ceylon (cca 180 A.D.).

The VI. decade, composed by a poetess called Kākkaipāṭiṉiyār
Nacceḷḷaiyār, is dedicated to another son of Imayavarampaṉ, king
Aṭukōṭpāṭṭuc Cēralātaṉ.

The II.-VI. decades of the collection are dedicated, as we have
just seen, to the Imayavarampaṇ-line of the *Cēral* kings, and deal
with 3 generations of rulers.

The VII. decade composed by the well-known Kapilar is a panegyric
on Celvakkaṭunkō Vāļiyātan who belonged to the second line
of the *Ceral,* the one called *Irumpoṟai*. The greatest king of this line
was probably Peruňcēral Irumpoṟai, the victor of Takaṭūr, praised
in the VIII. decade by Aricil Kiḻār.

The IX. decade is dedicated to Iruňcēral Irumpoṟai, the son of
Peruňcēral and the grandson of Celvakkaṭunkō. This decade was
composed by a *vēļāļa* poet called Peruṅkuṉṟūr Kiḻār. This king, too,
won victorious battles with the Cholas and Pandyas. Hence we see,
that decades VII-IX deal with the *Irumpoṟai* line of the *Cerals*, and
again with 3 generations. Both *Cēral* lines were connected through
marriages.

The whole work has an old, brief commentary, which must be
later than the 12th Cent. Patiṟṟuppattu was first printed in 1904,
edited by U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar who also supplied a detailed
commentary.

According to J. R. Marr (*op. cit*. 311), a number of data indicates
an indebtedness to some common but unknown sources: some of the
main themes are mentioned with variations in the decade poems,
the epilogues, and the later epics, *Cilappatikāram* and *Maṇimēkalai.*
Hence it is clear that these main themes were transmitted by (oral)
tradition.

5. *Akanāṉūṟu*

or "The four hundred (poems) in the *akam* genre” also called *Nețunto-*
*kai* or "The Anthology of Long (Poems)" is a collection of 400 stanzas
on love plus an invocatory stanza on Śiva by Peruntēvaṇār. The
number of verses in a stanza ranges from 13 to 31. The anthology
was directed by the Pāṇḍyan king Ukkiraperuvaļuti, and the name
of compiler is Uruttiracanman, the son of Maturai Uppūri Kuṭi
Kiḻāṉ. There is an old commentary for the first 90 stanzas; the
next 70 stanzas have a commentary by the first editor, V. Rajagopala
Iyengar; a modern commentary to the entire collection was
prepared by N. M. Venkataswamy Nattar and R. Venkatacalam
Pillai. The anthology was first published in 1920. The number of
poets is 143 (+ Peruntēvaṇār); 114, 117 and 165 are by anonymous
authors. The stanzas are arranged according to a peculiar scheme:
the stanzas bearing odd numbers belong to *pālai* (1, 3, 5, 7, . . .)
which means that half of the entire anthology is dedicated to *pālai*;
poems bearing number 2, 8, 12, 18, 22, 28, etc. belong to the *kuriň-*
*cittinai* (80 in all); poems bearing number 4, 14, 24. 34. 44, etc. are
*mullai* (40 in all); poems with number 6, 16, 26, 36, etc. are *marutam*
(total 40), and all stanzas having ten or its multiples (10, 20, 30, etc.)
are *neytal* (total 40). In *Naṟṟiṇai* and *Kuṛuntokai* the "landscapes"
(*tinais*) of the poems are not indicated and no scheme is adopted
with regard to their arrangement; S. Vaiyapuri Pillai sees in this
fact an indication that *Akanāṉūṟu* was collected later than Nar. and
*Kur. (HTLL*, p. 27).

The relatively long poems of this collection allowed scope to refer
to heroic episodes; the total number of historical allusions is 288
(Kailasapathy, *op*. *cit.*, 31). From the historical point of view, it is
one of the most valuable collections. Some of the more interesting
historical allusions are, e.g. in *Ak*. 251 and 265 (by Māmūlaṉār), the
allusion to the Nandas, and in *Ak.* 69, 281 and 375 to the Mauryas
*(Mōriyar*). In about five poems there are echoes of *puranic* legends
(Kṛṣṇa, Rāma, Paraśurāma etc.). There is quite a number of IndoAryan
loans (e.g. *vatuvai, nīti*, *cikaram*, *irāman* etc.). In *Ak*. 148 the
Yavanas are mentioned whose ships loaded with gold came to
Kerala, casting anchor in the river Culli, and returned heavy with
pepper.

6. *Paṟanāṉūṟu*

or "The four hundred (poems) in the genre *puṟam",* traditionally the
last of the anthologies, historically probably the most valuable, and
perhaps the latest of the collections; a careful study would no doubt
show that it contains stanzas of different chronological levels,
covering probably more than 2-3 centuries. It was considered by
the redactors of the anthologies as the collection of heroic poetry
par *excellence*; it is also simply called *puṟam*, or *purappāṭṭu*, the
heroic songs. Of the 400 poems, two, 266 and 268, are lost; some
poems are fragmentary. There is an invocatory stanza on Siva by
Peruntēvaṇār, so that the anthology as it stands contains 397 pieces.
The poets represented number 157; 14 poems are anonymous. An
old anonymous commentary is available up to stanza 266. There is
a modern popular commentary by Auvai S. Turaicāmi Pillai. The
anthology was first published by U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar (the
excellent introduction is dated September, 1894). 138 poems of the
anthology praise 43 kings belonging to the three great dynasties
(27 deal with the achievements of 18 *Cēral* kings, 74 poems praise
13 *Cōḻa* rulers, and 37 poems laud 12 *Pāṇṭiya* kings). 141 poems are
in praise of 48 chieftains, nine of them regarded prominent enough
to be treated in more than 4 poems each (e.g. Atiyamāṇ Neṭumāṇ
Añci, Vēļ, Pāri, Pēkaņ, Kāri etc.). Some kings emerge strikingly as
heroes of *Puṟam* poems; e.g. Karikālaṉ the Chola or Kuṭakkō
Nețuñcēralatan the Chera; clusters of poems in which certain heroes
emerge prominently are centred around certain incidents in the
heroes' lives (Kailasapathy, op*. cit*. 20). The redactors seem to have
tried to group the poems on the basis of the kings or chieftains
praised in them, but, at the same time, on the basis of many
different themes. 121 poems have defective colophons, and owing
to this fact their heroes are unknown. More than 100 poems beginning
with 248 and ending with 357 have been classified into 30
themes by the colophon writer(s); the heroes are anonymous; this
section of *Puṟam* may contain a very early strata of Tamil heroic
poetry. Thus, e.g., there are poems about widowhood and its
hardships (248-56), poems praising the prowess of the warhorse
(273, 299, 302-4), elegies (260-1, 264-5, 270, apart from other elegies
occurring earlier; all in all, there are 43 elegies in *Puṟam,* Kailasapathy,
op. cit. p. 24); from 358 to the end of the anthology, the
poems again refer to kings and chieftains. 141 poems in the anthology
belong to straight panegyric poetry called *pāṭāṇ*. As Kailasapathy
rightly says, “modern attempts to read ethical and moral
motivations into the words of the bards are particularly strained, if
not irrevelant" (p. 81), at least as far as most of the poems are
concerned. But there are a few poems with gnomic content, and
there are a few lines in this anthology-probably under the influence
of Jainism and Buddhism, and yet specifically Tamil in spiritwhich
may be regarded as showing elements of that pragmatic
approach and practical and universal ethics which underlies the
*Tirukkuṟaḷ.* There are also elements of reflexion, and some of the
poems are fully reflexive, the central idea being mostly the impermanence
of life in this world. These poems seem to be of later
origin than the more ancient, straightforward war and panegyric
songs.

7. *Porunarāṟṟuppaṭai*

or "The guide for war-bards" (traditionally the 2nd of the Lays
-very incorrectly called “idylls"!-) is probably the earliest among
the poems collected later into *Pattuppāṭṭu* anthology.

The genre *arruppațai* or "guide" is very productive: it is a poem
in which bards are directed by their fellow professionals to famous
heroes who are patrons of art. The genre is found in the heroic
Anthologies altogether 18 pieces in *Puṟam* and *Patiṟṟuppattu.*
Five of the "Ten Songs" belong to the genre.

The *Porunarāṟṟuppaṭai* sends a war-bard (*porunar*) to the famous
Chola king Karikāl. The poem consists of 248 lines in the *akaval*
metre (and a few *vaňci* lines) and was sung by Muṭattāmakkaṇṇiyār.
The poet gives biographical facts about the king (especially his
great victory at the battle of Veņņi), and describes his prowess,
conquests, his benign rule; the general wealth and fertility of his
Chola country is dealt with, and there is a charming description of
the beauties of the river Kāviri. There is also a delightful description
of the *virali*, the danseuse, whose charms are treated in minute
detail: she has, e.g., *varuntunāy nāvin peruntaku cīrați* “small feet of
great beauty similar to the tongue of a panting hound", she has
"young fair breasts set so close that a nib could not part them”
(*īrkku* iṭai pōkā ēr *iļa vana mulai)* and "her navel is like a water ripple”,
while "her venus' mound seems to be the seat of bees" *(nirp peyar*
*culiyin nivainta koppul*... *vantu iruppu anna pal kal alkul).* Finally,
there is a very realistic description of a poor minstrel, whose clothes
swarm with lice and mites, are soaked with sweat and much
patched-up (79-80 *irum pēṇum iruntu* iraikūți / *vērotu nanaintu* ...).
The inhabitants of *Cōḻanāṭu* are pictured as gay folk who likes to
eat meat and drink liquor. First published in 1889.

8. *Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai*

or "The guide for bards with the large lute" is another of this
"guidance" poems; attributed to Uruttiraṁkaņṇaṇār, who also
sang the *Paṭṭiṉappalai*, it has 500 lines in the *akaval* metre in praise


of the chieftain *Toṇṭaimāṉ Ilantiraiyaṉ*, the ruler of Kāňci. The
*perumpaṇar* are a class of minstrels (*pāṇar*) who obviously accompanied
their singing or reciting of the songs by playing the *pēriyāl* or
large lute. One special feature of this lay is the detailed description
of the five physiographical regions (*tiņai*) and a mythical account
about the origin of the *Tontaiman* dynasty. The city of Kāňci is
eulogized thus: "Among the great cities in this wide-placed earth,
girt by the sea that smells of fish, and canopied by the sky, this is
the greatest. It is an old city of ancient might and fame, abounding
in festivals in which many worship" (Kailasapathy's translation,
*op.* cit., p. 44). In the lines 316-317, the Yavaṇar are mentioned. The
poem describes also the life of the *ulavar*-peasants, and there is
much material that is of sociological interest. Published in 1889.

9. *Paṭṭiṉappalai*

The name is a compound of *pattinam* "maritime town" + *pālai* “a
flower (*Mimusops kauki*); desert tract, one of the love divisions".
It *is* a poem by Uruttirankaṇṇaṇār about the proposed separation of
a lady from her lover who wants to go to Kāvirippaṭṭiņam, the
capital of the Cholas. It has 301 lines, some of them in the *akaval,*
some in *vaňci* metre, in praise of the great Chola king Karikāl. First
there is a lengthy account of the city, then 5 lines dedicated to the
love element proper, and the rest of the lines deal with the exploits
of Karikāl the Great. The poem gives a vivid portrait of the life in
the great harbour, about the big ships and the merchandise they
bring, about the *paratavar*, fishermen, and the *kurumpar* and their
feasts-e.g. the cock-fights and ram-fights, dancing and winedrinking,
but also about Buddhist and Jaina monasteries as well as
about the worship of Murukaṉ. It describes Karikāl's struggles to
regain his rightful throne, his invasion of enemy lands, the slaves he
captured, his activities during peace-times, and his patronage to
bards and other artists.

As a lay glorifying a celebrated ancient Chola king, this poem
was very popular with the court panegyrists of the later Chola
empire (850-1200 A.D.). It is mentioned in inscriptions and literary
works of the 11th and 12th Cent. Some of these works say that
Karikāl gave 1,600.000 gold pieces (pon) to the bard for his song
—indeed a royal royalty! The name of the song was also *Vaňci*
*netum pattu,* "The Long Song in the *vaňci* metre". Indeed there are
153 lines in *vaňci* and 138 lines in *akaval* metre. According to J. R.
Marr (op. cit. 435) the *vaňci* lines were introduced to effect a change
of rhythm that would please the listeners. The short staccato *vaňci*
lines with their swinging movement were apparently more suited
for cataloguing things besides serving as a deliberate contrast to the
*akaval* lines (Kailasapathy, *op. cit.* 39). Published in 1889.

10. *Kuriñcippāṭṭu,*

meaning liter. "The song of the mountains", narrates the story of
premarital love among the people living in the hilly regions. It is the
love-poem par *excellence*, ascribed to the great Kapilar (also called
*Peruňkuriñci*, "The large mountain song"). The story preserved in
the colophon accompanying the commentary says that it was
composed for the instruction of an Aryan king, called Pirakattan,
cf. Skt. *bṛhat* "great". This story and the fact that the poem
contains a catalogue of 99 flowers typical for the *kuṟiňci* region,
appear to substantiate the suggestion that the poem was composed
as a "model".[^pattupattu] This is roughly the content of the lay: A chieftain of
the hill-tribe falls in love at first sight with a fair maiden. The
love is reciprocated. The girl's foster-sister helps the lovers to meet
and enjoy their love. But the parents find the change in their
daughter strange and suspicious. In the belief that she is ill they
invite magicians and exorcists, but the cleverness of the foster-sister
overcomes all obstacles, and, finally, when the parents are told that
the young man saved their daughter twice-once from the danger of
drowning and another time from a rogue-elephant-they give their
consent. The poem has 261 lines in the *akaval* metre. There has been
some doubt about Kapilar's authorship (cf. Sivaraja Pillai, *Chrono-*
*logy* of Early Tamils, 202, who has called the poem a near-forgery
committed upon a famous bard, cf. also J. R. Marr, op. *cit*. 357).
Published in 1889.

[^pattupattu]: Cf. S. Vithiananthan, *The Pattuppāṭṭu*-a *historical, social and linguistic*
*study,* PhD thesis, Univ. of London, 1950, p. 20. The catalogues were a rather
typical feature in ancient Tamil poetry. We do find catalogues of different
items (e.g. the seven great donors), and perhaps the longest catalogue is this
one in the *Kuṟiňcippāṭṭu.* In the midst of the description of a girl and her
foster-sister the song bursts into a methodical enumeration of the flowers
characteristic for the hilly region (*ll.* 61-95). The presence of this catalogue
has, as Kailasapathy says (op. cit. p. 131), discomforted many modern
critics. Chelliah who translated the "Ten Songs" says:
this list seems
an intrusion, and somewhat detracts from the high poetic level of the poem"
(p. 195). But this attitude was rightly criticised by X. S. Thani Nayagam
(*Nature* in *Ancient Tamil Poetry*, 1953), and we may fully agree with Kailasapathy
according to whom the presence of the catalogue need cause no
surprise (p. 131). Bardic training included information pertinent to flora and
fauna, among other types of information. And our poem was very probably
meant to be an exercise in singing the *kuṟiňci* theme, a model poem, illustrating
a type, an informative poem on the *kuṟiňci* situation (M. Varadarajan,
The *Treatment of* Nature. . . p. 62). It should also be noted that the
catalogue itself has a high phonaesthetic quality, cf. on cen *kāntaḷ* āmpal
*aniccam tankayak kuvaḷai kuṟiňci vețci*. . . (26).


11. *Malaipaṭukaṭām*.

The title is somewhat obscure; according to some authors, it means
"the secretion oozing from the mountain"; according to others, it
means "the sound of *kaṭām* which appears in the mountains”.[^nature-elephant-mountain] The
title is taken from a line (348) of the poem itself (and must have been
considered poetically very striking; this tendency to pick up
"catch-words" or attractive phrases from the poems and give them
as titles of poems, or names of authors, if the proper name of the
author was lost, is well attested from a number of Anthology poems).
The lay has yet another name, *Kuttarāṛruppaṭai,* i.e. "The guide of
actors". The patron celebrated in the lay is Naṉṉaṉ (almost unknown
from other sources), and the name of the poet Peruňkunçūr
Perunkaucikaṇār. The poem has 583 lines. Various aspects of the
life of different communities in the hero's land are described, and
the poem contains exquisite pictures of nature. Published in 1889.

[^nature-elephant-mountain]: Cf. P. Kannappa Mudaliyar, *Tamil nūl varalāṟu*, 1962, p. 109. The line
runs *malaipatukaṭām matirattu* iyampa. Probably it is a comparison
of an
elephant to a mountain; the oozing stands for the sounds emanating
from the
mountainous region.

12. *Netunalvāṭai*

means literally "The Good Long North Wind", implying by
metonymy the Cold Season, which is the background of this
narrative, ascribed to the famous Nakkīrar, and composed in the
akaval, totalling 188 lines. The lay is a unique blend of love and
heroic elements, and the pains of separation are its predominant
features. It is artistically rather complex and subtle, so that it is
often regarded, and probably rightly so, as the best or one of the
best of the lays of the bardic corpus.

In respect of language, diction, imagery and subject-matter it is
of course-only naturally so-in no way different from the rest of
the lays; but, in addition, it has some features that set it apart from
the rest: it begins with the beautiful description of nature during the
rainy season: "The earth is cold ... From chilly boughs hang
coloured drops of rain ... When sharp winds blow to chill the very
hills "One then travels across the country to the city, to the
king's capital, Maturai. One sees details of the luxury life in the city,
and enters the palace, the royal bedchamber, where, surrounded by
her maids, the languishing queen lies plunged into grief
... “with
the tip of her rosy finger now and then she spills / The shining
tear-drops that in heavy lids / collected, roll down fast”. Her
thoughts are far away—and suddenly one is taken to the king's
winter-camp (? at Talaiyālaṁkāṇam), where her lord (? Neṭuňceḻiyaṉ),
“at war with numberless foes", is fully absorbed in his stern
duties. In one of the most vivid scenes in the entire bardic poetry
one sees the king inspecting at night the camp with wounded
warriors. The climax of the poem is a prayer to the Goddess of
Victory, Korravai. As Kailasapathy says (42), “the poem is indeed a
*tour de force,* exhibiting the bard at his best." Published in 1884.

13. *Maturaikkāňci*

is the longest of the lays, containing 782 lines in the *akaval* metre
interspersed with a great number of *vaňci* lines, ascribed to the bard
Māṅkuṭi Marutaṉār who was probably the chief court poet of
Neṭuňceḻiyaṉ (whose fame the poem celebrates), and also the author
of a number of stanzas in *Paṟanāṉūṟu.* A *kāňci* is a later genre of
"Sangam" poetry; it can be translated as a “hint” or “gentle hint",
a kind of "moral epistle" (M. S. Purnalingam Pillai) based on the
philosophy of the instability and perishability of world and life.
The poet was probably well versed in this particular genre (cf. his
poems in Puṟam anthology). The title can be translated as "The
good counsel (given to the king at the city) of Maturai” (according to
an old commentator). The poem indeed contains some didactic
matter, as do other stanzas composed by Māṁkuți Marutaṉār or
Māṅkuṭi Kiḻār. There is a graphic description of city life: the
description begins with the morning market-place and makes a full
circle of twenty-four hours (including some description of Buddhist
monasteries and Jain shrines, of the various riches brought back by
the king's warriors from raiding expeditions, a vivid portraiture of
thieves etc.). The author was an exceptionally keen observer of men
and manners: he has captured successfully the sights and sounds of
Maturai in the morning, in the afternoon, during dusk, mignight and
dawn. There is absolutely no love element in the poem. The first
portion is dedicated to the valour and victories of the greatest hero
of the Pandyas, Neṭuňceḻiyaṉ. The poem ends with a "good council"
to the king to be happy throughout the allotted portion of his life.[^makilntu]
There are relatively many Aryan loanwords. *Maturaik*. looks like a
later "lay"; Neṭuňceḻiyaṉ might have been ruling in Maturai around
215 A.D. And, indeed, this lay might be dated well in the beginning
of the 3rd Century. Published in 1889.

[^makilntu]: *makilntu* initu *uraimati peruma | varaintu* nī perra nāļ *ūliyaiyē.*

14. *Mullaippāṭṭu,*

sung by nappūtaṉār, is the shortest and one of the most beautiful
of the lays. It contains 103 lines in the *akaval,* out of which only 33
deal specifically with the love theme: of wifely patience and selfcontrol
shown by a heroine while her warrior-husband (anonymous)
is away on some military campaign. The remaining lines describe
the expedition of the hero: the temporary camp in the forest, the
hero's chamber, specially constructed by the Yavanas who are
fierce-eyed (61) and clad in toga-like garments; mention is made of
*mileccar*, (Skt. *mleccha-*), employed as the king's body-guards,
not knowing Tamil and speaking only with gestures (65-66).
Interesting is also the mention made of unlearned youngsters (or
servants)[^vatamoli] who are the mahouts of king's elephants and who utter
Northern words (or speak Northern speech).

[^vatamoli]: *vatamoli payirri kalla ilaiñar* (35-36); the phrase *kallā ilaiñar* occurs also
in *Porunar*. 100 (for attendants or servants of the king), and *kallā ilaiyar*
occurs in Ciṟupāṇ. 33.

Unlike the other poem on separation between lovers, *Neṭuṉalvāṭai,*
this lay ends in a note of hope: the triumphant hero is returning
swiftly home. Published in 1889.

15. *Cirupaṇārruppatai,*

"A guide of the minstrel playing the small lute", has been sometimes
acclaimed as the best of the "guidance" poems, though it is the
shortest of them: it has 296 lines in the *akaval* metre. The chief
honoured in this poem is Nalliyakkōṭaṉ of the *Ōy* tribe (cf. *Puṟ*.
176). The poet's name is Narrattaṇār. It is a typical "guide" poem,
possessing all essential features of this genre. All the conventional
scenery is described, as well as the valour and especially the munificence
of the hero. The fact that the Seven Great Donors "are
mentioned in a catalogue lends colour to the argument that the
poem contains later material" (Kailasapathy, 45). It indeed seems
to be the last composed in the series of the *Pattuppāṭṭu* (*HTLL* by
S. Vaiyapuri, 33 and *CET* by Pillai, p. 202: imitation of the *Perum-*
*pāṇ*.). “The fact that not only the seven minor chieftains, but also
the Three Kings and some of their cities are mentioned in a retrospective
manner and with remarkable objectivity strongly suggests
a later date for the lay" (Kailasapathy, 46). Tamil and Maturai are
associated in a special way, and, as Kailasapathy points out, in this
lay the connexions between Tamil and the *Pāṇṭiya* capital which
became later legendary, may be seen in its evolution (p. 46, cf.
*tamiḻ* nilaipperra *maturai* 66). Rather powerful is the poet's
description of his poverty: the starved bitch laying in the ruined
kitchen near a cold hearth with her blind and helpless pups, refusing
to suckle them; the wife of the bard cooks without salt (as she cannot
afford it) some herbs which she gathered from refuge heaps... Lines
14 to 40 contain one of the most detailed and meticulous descriptions
-but also rather charming-of a woman's body found in classical
Tamil literature; this in a kind of *antāti* arrangement (the offset of a
line repeated as the onset of the next line) including the simile known
to us from *Porunar.:* the small feet similar to the tongues of panting
dogs (16-17). Published in 1889.

Such phrases and formulae, recurring again and again (cf. the
construction *kalla ilaiyar* or *iļaiňar,* recurring e.g. in *Porunar*. 100,
*Mullaip*. 35-36 and *Ciṟupāṇ.* 33) show how intimate and close was
the connection between the various poems of the corpus, and how
stereotyped and conventional is the language of this bardic poetry.
We may indeed say that the 15 poems and collections of poems just
described constitute one single corpus-in many ways unique in the
literature of the world-stylized to such an extent that it is almost
impossible to distinguish what belongs properly to each author.
*The Metre*
