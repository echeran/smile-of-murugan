<p>The entire corpus of earlier classical poetry is composed in two metres: 1 <em>akaval</em> and <em>vaňci</em>.</p>
<p>The basic metrical unit 2 is the <em>acai,</em> 3 which is of two types: the <em>nēr</em> and the niṟai. The <em>nĕr</em> is a simple metrical unit, long or short, に which may or may not be followed by a consonant, that is (C) V (C). We designate it by The niṟai is a compound metrical unit, made up of two short syllables, or a short followed by a long syllable, =.</p>
<p>✓ with or without a consonant following, i.e.&nbsp;(C) VCV (C). We symbolize the <em>niṟai</em> by We see that the <em>nēr</em> may be quantitatively long or short, whereas the first, initial syllable of a <em>niṟai</em> is always short; in terms of Western notation, then, a <em>nēr</em> is always (a macron), while a <em>niṟai</em> may be (pyrrhic) or (iambic).4 If either of these two are followed by -u or by the “overshort” <em>-u,</em> they become <em>nērpu</em> and niraipu, i.e.&nbsp;modified <em>nēr</em> and <em>niṟai</em>. This does not apply to cases where the -u follows a single short syllable, whence it becomes not a <em>nērpu</em> but a <em>niṟai.</em> 5 The possible combinations of these four units (<em>nēr, nērpu, niṟai,</em> niraipu) are sixteen. And all of them are permitted in the <em>akaval</em> metre. The most common combinations are or <em>tēmā,</em> or <em>pulimā, kuvilam</em> and <em>karuvilam</em>. These combinations form the next level in the metrical structure the level of the <em>cir</em> “feet”. The feet proper to the <em>akaval</em> are termed <em>iyaṟcīr</em> or “natural feet”, also <em>āciriyaccīr</em> or “feet proper to the <em>āciriyam</em> (= <em>akaval</em>) metre”.</p>

<p>1 For the most recent treatment of Tamil classical prosody, cf.&nbsp;K. Zvelebil, An <em>Introduction</em> to <em>Tamil Classical Prosody,</em> Hoe &amp; Co., Madras, 1972. 2 Some writers translated <em>acai</em> as “syllable” which is incorrect (cf.&nbsp;the criticism of this term by J. R. Marr, op. cit. 273). acai is not a syllable, neither is it a mora. Vithianathan translates it as “quantitative unit of a movement” (op. cit. 273), Kailasapathy as “basic metrical unit” (op. <em>cit</em>. 140). I hesitated for some time between “prosodic” or “metrical syllable” and some kind of “unit”, and then, after discussing the matter with J. R. Marr, decided for “fundamental” or “basic metrical unit”. ³ Cf. <em>DED</em> 39: <em>acai</em> “to move, stir, etc.”.</p>
<p>4 Cf. J. R. Marr, op. cit. 415.</p>
<p>5 E.g. in the words <em>karu</em> = and <em>mulu</em> =.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>The combination of feet constitutes a line of poetry, termed <em>aṭi</em>. The standard line consists of four feet. Although there are lines of two, five etc. feet, the ideal line is that of four feet and hence is called <em>alavați</em> or “measured line”.</p>
<p>In the <em>akaval</em> or <em>āciriyam</em> metre, the standard line has four feet (= eight <em>acai</em>). Only the penultimate line consists of three feet. Elsewhere, a three-feet line is exceptional.1 The <em>vaňci</em> metre (which occasionally occurs with the <em>akaval</em> in the songs of the <em>Pattuppāṭṭu</em> anthology) has a somewhat different scheme. The <em>vaňci</em> foot is made of three <em>acais</em>, e.g. ― = — <em>nērnirai-</em> <em>nēr</em>. The possible combinations of the four <em>acais</em> are sixty for the <em>vaňcippā</em>. The usual <em>vaňci</em> line has two feet, so that it usually has six <em>acais</em>. The last line in a <em>vaňci</em> stanza may be in <em>akaval.</em> The next (and for our purposes the final) important concept to discuss is the <em>toṭai,</em> lit. “connexion, joining”, “fastening, tying”, “series, succession”, i.e.&nbsp;the art of joining the lines of a poem in succession, making use of “rhyme”, alliteration, assonance, contrast etc.2 The line is considered by indigenous theoreticians as the basic and self-contained unit, in fact, as the largest single unit in a poem. According to Pērāciriyar, “the poet completes the intended meaning in each line; he does not need another line”. <em>Toṭai</em> is precisely the art of stringing together lines so that they constitute a song. There are various kinds of <em>toṭai.</em> For our purposes, we shall mention just two: <em>etukai</em> and <em>mōnai. Etukai</em> is the “consonance” in the coda of the first closed syllables in the feet, e.g.&nbsp;in <em>peru</em> (1st line)… <em>aru</em> (2nd line), the – is the seat of <em>etukai</em> ; in <em>pāțu</em> (1st line). . <em>kōṭi</em> (2nd line), the – is the seat of <em>etukai</em>. <em>Mõnai</em> is alliteration, like in <em>māyōṇ</em> <em>mārpil</em> or <em>paranta pāți</em>.</p>
<p><em>Specimen Analysis</em> The basic prosodic and rhetoric features of classical Tamil poetry will now be demonstrated through the analysis of three selected poems.</p>
<p>1 It was very probably rightly suggested by John R. Marr (op. cit. 464) that the three-feet penultimate line in <em>akaval</em> might have indicated the approaching end of a song. Kailasapathy (op. cit. 143-143) suggests an analogy of the penultimate line to the cadence in a musical composition. 2 The next constituent is nōkku “gaze, look, view”, i.e.&nbsp;the cohesion of the various elements into one single whole; Kailasapathy says that it connects “the smooth flow of meaning” (op<em>. cit.</em> 146).</p>
<p><em>Kuṟuntokai</em> 119 (by Catti Nātaānr) <em>ciruvel laravi navvarik kuruļai</em> <em>kāna yānai yanṇańki yāan</em> <em>kiļaiyaṇ muļaivā ļeyirraļ</em> <em>valaiyuṭaik kaiyaḍem maṇanki yōļē</em> In literal translation, this means: “little-white-snake of lovely-striped young-body jungle elephant troubling like the young-girl sprouts-brightness toothed-female bangle(s) possessing hand(s)-female”.</p>
<p>In A.K. Ramanujan’s charming translation: As a little white snake with lovely stripes on its young body troubles the jungle elephant this slip of a girl her teeth like sprouts of new rice her wrists stacked with bangles troubles me.</p>
<p>The prosodic pattern is as follows: 67 (The <em>Interior Landscape</em>, 1967) We observe in this stanza four lines of four feet, the penultimate line has three feet; the metre contains only feet of two metrical units <em>(acai</em>) each, of the pattern = and ; these feet are called <em>ir acai</em> cir “two-unit-feet”. The metre is therefore <em>akaval</em> or <em>āciriyam</em>.</p>
<p>As for the <em>toṭai,</em> there is e.g.&nbsp;a <em>etukai</em> or “consonance” between the 3rd and 4th line (i/!/<em>aiya!—va|l|ai)</em>, and there is, e.g., a <em>mõnai</em> or “alliteration” in the 2nd line: /<em>y/</em>anai /<em>y</em>/<em>aṇanki</em> /<em>y/äañ</em>(ku). Now for the phonaesthetic analysis: almost all consonants belong to the nasal (so-called <em>mellinam</em>) or liquid (<em>iṭaiyinam</em>) series; the most favoured is the retroflex liquid ? which occurs 8 times. The occlusives are rare: c occurs only once, there is no <em>t</em>, k as a tense stop occurs only 3 times. This consonantal structure of the stanza results in a soft, mellifluous, liquid effect, like the murmur of a mountain stream. The distribution of the sounds is also interesting; each line has its own specific phonic structure, resulting in a specific phonaesthetic impression:</p>
<p>I. (c) rv y n nk y n(k) 2. kny rv (n) vv r (kk) rỊ 3. y(!) m lvl y rr ! 4. vyt (kk) y 1 mm n nk y! Observe the various patterns in consonantal sequences in terms of feet. Given enough space one could discern similar patterns with regard to the vowels. Every stanza-every line, to be precise, since the line is a finished and self-contained unit-has its own phonic structure which is <em>functional.</em> The functional status of phonaesthetic properties, of “orchestration” (instrumentovka), is one of the very important and characteristic features of classical Tamil poetry. Much later, there comes a period in the development of Tamil literature when like in most literatures–the purely formal qualities become the most important features of a poem (e.g.&nbsp;in medieval and late medieval devotional literature). Not so, however, in early old Tamil classical texts: there, the formal side is most often-though not always in perfect unity with the thought-content, and hence the purely formal aspect of the poems is fully functional. Next the rhetoric analysis in terms of traditional Tamil poetics, i.e.&nbsp;in terms of the first and most ancient descriptions of these matters as preserved in Iṟaiyaṉār’s <em>Akapporuḷ</em> and in the 3rd part of <em>Tolkāppiyam (Poruļatikāram)</em>.</p>
<p>The two fundamental genres which were mentioned several times before are the <em>akam</em> “love” and <em>puṟam</em> “war”. It is obvious that our poem belongs to <em>akam</em> poetry. Within the <em>akam</em> genre, the first dichotomy runs between well-matched love <em>(akam</em> proper) and ill-matched love. Our poem belongs to the genre of well-matched love (see detailed discussion later). Akam proper is subdivided into five erotic situations, five phases of love, which are matched with the physiographic regions; these are the five <em>tiṇais</em>. Our <em>tiṇai</em> is called <em>kuṟiňci</em> or “lovers union”, appropriate to the mountainous region.</p>
<p>How can we tell? In every classical Tamil poem, diagnostic features are present which, to an informed listener and reader, reveal immediately the type of <em>tiṇai</em> and theme in which the poem is composed. Sometimes they are abundant. Sometimes, they are only a few. They are conventional and traditional. There is great fixity, great stylization. The poet is obliged to abide by traditions. The bardic practice</p>
<p>-both in the <em>akam</em> and in the <em>puṟam</em> genres-is conditioned by traditional material. The inner tension, the very dynamism of classical Tamil poetry arises out of this relation between the traditional materia represented by conventions and formulae, and the poet’s art of improvisation. As Kailasapathy observes, simultaneous freedom and limitation constitute the dynamism of Tamil classical poetry. Now what is this traditional and conventionalized matter in our particular poem? What are the diagnostic features? First, there are some elements of the so-called <em>karupporuḷ</em> present here, i.e.&nbsp;of “things born” or “native”: the strata of <em>karupporuḷ!</em> is represented by the “snake” <em>(aravu</em>) and by the “jungle elephant” <em>(kana yanai</em>); that is by the beasts typical for the mountainous region (<em>kuriňci</em>). The word <em>kāṇam</em> “jungle, forest” also belongs to this strata. As far as the uripporuḷ is concerned, or the strata which deals with human situations and feelings, the key-word is <em>aṇaňku</em> “trouble”; “be troubled, afflicted, suffer pain”, “afflict”-a feeling typical again for the <em>kuṟiňci</em> situation. The “troubles” or “sufferings of love” belong to the characteristic behavioural features of the “mountain-poetry” (union of lovers). There are no other elements of conventions present in the poem; but these four catch-words or key-items (snake, elephant, forest, and afflictions of love) are sufficient and diagnostic. This is the basic traditional and conventional material around which the poem has been built. The presence of representative features of all conventions is certainly not obligatory. But some <em>must</em> be present. This is the kind of limitation imposed on the poet: first, the broadest frame-he may decide between love (<em>akam</em>) or war (<em>puram</em>) as his two main themes; now, if he decides for love, he again has a binary choice: well-matched or ill-matched. Within <em>akam</em> proper, he has to make his choice among the five situations; and after he has chosen one, he is obliged to give clues in terms of <em>mutal</em> or “First things”, and/or karu or “Native things” and/or <em>uri</em> or “Appropriate human feelings”. He is also expected to use the technique of direct and indirect comparison and suggestion (inference). Within this framework, he is relatively free.</p>
<p>As far as the last point is concerned: in the poem under analysis, the comparison is rather explicit; actually, the whole poem is a wonderful simile (made explicit by the use of comparative particle <em>anku</em> “similarly, of that nature; like, as”): the lover-a jungle elephant (<em>kāna yānai</em>); the sweetheart-a small young snake: no</p>
<p>real danger for the mighty elephant; and yet–she troubles and afflicts him, by her elusiveness, mockery, and who knows what. There is also the <em>technique</em> of <em>suggestion</em> used here, or rather comparison by suggestion, which is not apparent at first sight and which requires knowledge of some cultural traits: the <em>avvari</em> “lovely stripes” at the body of the snake hint at the fair lines, stripes and/or dots (vari) which were considered to be marks of beauty on the body of a woman (particularly on her breasts and venus’ mound). Let us now analyse another poem, <em>Kuṟuntokai</em> 3, ascribed to Tēvakulattār. First the original Tamil text again: <em>nilattinum</em> peritē <em>vāninu muyarntanru</em> <em>nīriņu māraļa vinrē cărar</em> <em>karunkōr kuriйcip pūkkoṇṭu</em> peruntē nilaikkum <em>nāṭanoṭu natpē</em> ‘earth-than big(ger), sky-than high(er) water-than hard(er)-to-fathom mountain-slope black-stalk-<em>kuriйci</em>-flower(s) taking rich-honey-making-country’s-lord-with love’.</p>
<p>Bigger than earth, certainly, higher than the sky, more unfathomable than the waters is this love for this man of the mountain slopes where bees make rich honey from the flowers of the <em>kuṟiňci</em> that has such black stalks.</p>
<p>(A. K. Ramanujan, The <em>Interior Landscape</em>, 1967) Metric analysis will tell us that this is a poem of the same structure as the one preceding: four lines, each of four feet, the penultimate line has three feet; feet of two and three metrical units are used. This kind of stanza (which is technically known as <em>nēricai āciriyap-</em> pā) seems to have been the earliest type of stanza in the <em>akaval</em> metre, and hence the earliest type of stanzaic structure extant in the language. The metric patterns are Before we go into the rhetoric analysis, let us observe yet another property which many or most of these early Tamil poems composed as nēricai āciriyappās have: they are divided, from the point of</p>
<p>thought-content <em>and</em> form, into two parts: the first part, usually longer (purely quantitatively; in a 4-line stanza, the first 2 lines, sometimes part of the 3rd line), deals with the <em>mutal</em> and/or karupporuḷ, i.e.&nbsp;with the time-space continuum as basic background, and with the concrete representations of the five-fold physiographic regions in <em>Kur</em>. 119, we have in those lines the snake and the elephant; in this stanza, we have in the first 2 lines the earth, the sky, the waters, the mountain-slopes, and the 3rd line, too, is filled with the <em>karupporuḷ</em> material: the black-stalked <em>kuṟiňci</em> flowers. The second part, usually shorter (in a 4-line stanza it usually begins in the penultimate 3-feet line, or sometimes only in the very last line) contains the substance of the poem, its essence (<em>uripporul</em>), the pointe: in <em>Kur</em>. 119, the human element appears in the 3rd line, and the essential feeling (the trouble of love) as the last word of the 4th line; in <em>Kur</em>. 3, the human element occurs only in the very last line <em>(nātan</em>), and the <em>pointe,</em> the essential feeling, again as the very last word of the whole stanza (<em>naṭpē</em> “love”).</p>
<p>This kind of structure gives to the classical Tamil stanzas a wonderful conciseness, terseness, pithiness and an inner tension which is resolved usually at the very end of the stanza. Sometimes, though, the procedure is exactly opposite, and the same effect is achieved by a reverse technique: the <em>pointe,</em> the essence of the poem is revealed in the very first line, it is a sort of direct attack on the listener; and what follows, is a kind of “decrescendo”, an unfolding of the <em>pointe</em>. But always, in the best stanzas of the collections <em>(tokai</em>), in both genres, <em>akam</em> and <em>puṟam</em>, there is a very conscious striving after a perfect and extremely potent and effective <em>form</em>. The genre of <em>Kur.</em> 3 is <em>akam</em> or love, clearly well-matched love or <em>akam</em> proper; the basic theme-<em>tinai</em>-is <em>kuṟiňci</em> or lover’s union. The time-space continuum is not explicitly given in this poem; neither is it implicit in some suggestion or other. However, according to some interpretations, the main components of the place or <em>nilam</em> subdivision of the <em>mutal</em> are earth, water, fire, wind and sky; and in this particular poem, three of them, earth, sky and water are actually mentioned, to stress the greatness and depth and intensity of the heroine’s love. As far as the <em>karupporuḷ</em> or concrete representations of the physiographic regions are concerned, we have here no gods, but the term <em>nāṭan</em> for the lover; this is a specific term used for the chief of the mountain-tribe, so that this in itself provides the clue for the <em>tiṇai</em>; second, among the birds and beasts and insects,</p>
<p>we have, implicitly, the bees, in the sphere of flora we have the <em>kuṟiňci</em> flower, and honey which stands for the bees, being the typical conventional apparatus of the “mountain-poetry”. The uripporuḷ or the psychological essence is represented by the word <em>naṭpu</em> “love”. According to some commentaries, the attributes <em>karunkōl</em> “black-stalked” and <em>perunten</em> “rich honey” belong to so-called iṟaicci or suggestion (or inference) in form of some additional material, as qualifier or adjunct to some basic concept: the <em>kuṟiňci</em> flowers with black stalks stand for the woman in love; the bees gathering honey from these flowers are supposed to stand for the man’s action of gathering sweetness from the pleasure of the lover’s union. As in the previous poem, the comparison is explicit, made overt by the use of the ablative plus -um: “big(ger) <em>than</em> earth, high(er) <em>than</em> sky” etc. What is compared is the intensity, the depth and greatness of the heroine’s <em>naṭpu</em>, love.</p>
<p>Finally, a third poem, from the same <em>tokai</em>, collection, <em>Kuṟuntokai</em> 68, ascribed to Aḷḷur Nanmullai. I abstain this time from quoting the original. Here is Ramanujan’s lovely translation: The bare root of the bean is pink like the leg of a jungle hen, and herds of deer attack its overripe pods.</p>
<p>For the harshness of this early frost there is no cure but the breast of my man.</p>
<p>(The <em>Interior Landscape</em>, 1967) The genre is obviously <em>akam,</em> love, and <em>akam</em> proper, or wellmatched love. The tiṇai is a mixed one; and this is no chance, nor an error on the part of the poet. How do we know it is a mixed “poetic situation”? As far as the time-space continuum is concerned, the poem mentions explicitly “early frost” (this comes under <em>kālam</em>, time): “early dew” is typical for <em>kuṟiňci</em> or “lover’s union”. Now to the “things native” or “concrete representations”: the bird mentioned is the jungle hen, typical for <em>mullai</em> or forest, appropriate to “patient waiting” in terms of the phases of love; the beast mentioned is the deer, again typical for <em>mullai</em> or the “patient waiting” situation. The “bean” also belongs to <em>mullai</em>. The <em>uripporuḷ</em> or essential human feeling is defined as “memory and desire”: that is, “memory of lovers’ union” (<em>kuriňci</em>) and “desire of patient waiting” (<em>mullai</em>): the <em>tiṇai</em> of this poem, the “situation” is thus kuṟiňci <em>mullai</em>, a <em>mixed</em> tiṇai, a mixed situation. There is,</p>
<p>3 again, an explicit comparison present (the pink root of the bean compared to the leg of the jungle hen). But there is also suggestion and inference in this stanza: the bare root of the bean, pink and attacked by herds of deer in the “season of early dew” is suggestive of the bare body and soul of the waiting, pining woman, attacked by memories of union and longing for embrace.</p>
