<p>The term New Poetry is used here in a limited and technical sense of the Tamil expression putuk kavitai or <em>putiyak</em> kavitai, i.e.&nbsp;for the works of a particular group of “new poets” who made their appearance approximately after 1958-59, and whose poems were collectively published for the first time in October 1962 in a slender yet path-breaking volume entitled <em>Putukkuralkaļ</em> “New Voices”. It is therefore not used for post-Bharati Tamil poetry, not even for post-Bharatidasan Tamil poetry. I do not deal in this chapter with such influential modern poets as S. D. S. Yogi, not even with some “young” contemporary poets like the “people’s bard” Paṭṭukkōṭṭai Kalyāṇacuntaram, or like the very popular Kaṇṇatācaṉ. All these are modern poets, but not “new” poets in the sense of the term mentioned above. These modern poets may indulge in <em>vers libre,</em> or be fiercefully politically oriented and proclaim themselves as ultra-red revolutionaries, but, in fact, there is nothing basically new, creative, and “revolutionary” about their writing. Their poetry is a sort of anaemic imitation of either Bharati or Bharatidasan or S. D. S. Yogi.</p>
<p>What is meant by the term “new poetry” here is different both from the moribund orthodox pandit-like versification as well as from the sentimentally romantic outpourings of the hosts of “modern” but not “new” poets.</p>
<p>The “new poets” have, in fact, general features in common which distinguish their work from the rest.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Historically speaking, the “new poets” have a very definite line of descent which is indicated in the chart appended to this chapter and which includes, in succession, the four great names of S. Bharati, Puthumaippitthan, K. P. Rajagopalan and N. Pichamurti. The other features of “new poetry” are:</p></li>
<li><p>Radical break with the past and its traditions, though not a negation of the cultural heritage.</p></li>
<li><p>Disregard for traditional forms and prosodic structures, and a new utilization of basic prosodic properties of Tamil.</p></li>
<li><p>A great amount of experimentation with language and form of poetry, based on intellection, and at least some acquaintance with French, English, American etc. modern poetry.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>of 5. Preoccupation with very contemporary matters and inclusion hitherto ignored <em>sujets</em>. If traditional subjects are handled, they are treated from a new, non-traditional angle and point of view. new, The beginnings of “new poetry”-if we disregard a somewhat similar intellectual and emotional milieu of some of the Siddhar poems may be found in Subrahmanya Bharati’s (1882-1921) works, in his “prose-poetry” as well as in a few stray poems which are very striking from the point of view of form and content. Incidentally, Bharati considered himself to be a spiritual descendent of the <em>cittar</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Siddhars many have been ere my time!<br>
I am another come to this land”.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bharati’s prose-poems and free-verse experiments opened new vistas and tried new techniques in Tamil poetry as early as during the decade of 1910-1920. Consider e.g.&nbsp;lines like these:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mind is the enemy within<br>
And cuts our roots.<br>
Parasite Mind alone is the enemy.<br>
Let us peck at it.<br>
Let us tear it.<br>
Come, let us hunt it down.¹<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CHART 17 S. Bharati’s prose-poetry and poems like Ülikkuttu and Akkinikkuñcu Puthumaippitthan K. P. Rajagopalan N. Pichamurti (T. M. C. Raghunathan) (S. Vallikkannan) C. S. Chellappa (S. Ramaswamy)</p>
<p>One of the most amazing poems of Bharati is <em>Ūļikkūttu</em> or “The Dance of Doom” which I quote here in a good though not quite equivalent (partial) translation by Prema Nandakumar (op. cit. 86).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As the worlds mightily clash<br>
And crash in resounding thunder,<br>
As blood-dripping demon-spirits<br>
Sing in glee amid the general ruin,<br>
To the beat and the tune<br>
Leapest thou, Mother, in dance ecstatic<br>
Dread Mahakali!<br>
Chamundi! Gangali!<br>
Mother, Mother,<br>
Thou hast drawn me<br>
To see thee dance!<br>
When the demon-hosts clash<br>
Hitting head against head,<br>
When the knocking and breaking<br>
Beat rhythmic time,<br>
When the sparks from your eyes<br>
Reach the ends of the earth,<br>
Then is the doomed hour<br>
Of universal death!<br>
<br>
When Time and the three worlds<br>
Have been cast in a ruinous heap,<br>
When the frenzy has ceased<br>
And a lone splendour has wakened,<br>
Then auspicious Siva appears<br>
To quench thy terrible thirst.<br>
Now thou smilest and treadst with him<br>
The blissful Dance of Life!<br>

<p>After Bharati, it was the versatile Putumaippitan (1906-1948) who deviated from traditional poetry; he did not live long enough to mature into a great poet, and Putumaippittaṉ the short-story writer is no doubt more successful than Putumaippittaṉ the poet. A direct line leads from him to T. M. C. Raghunathan who wrote a few very promising poems, but has been lately rather unproductive. K. P. Rajagopalan (1902-1944) died too young to exert any lasting influence on the present developments. There is, however, one great man who has carried on the fire of the Thirties to the post-war period. This man is N. Pichamurti (Piccamürtti, b. 1900). He admits that he was drawn to modern poetic forms only after reading Walt Whitman. His best-known poem <em>Kāṭṭuvāttu</em> (“Wild duck”) was probably one of the decisive turning-points in the development of modern Tamil poetry.</p>
<p>The year 1959 may be considered as the real critical moment in these developments. In this year, C. S. Chellappa (b. 1912), himself a good prose-writer and poet, and probably the most unorthox and modern-oriented literary critic, founded his review <em>Eḻuttu,</em> “Writing”, which opened its pages for anything new and truly creative. The results of the new ferment were visible in a path-breaking and all-important slender collection entitled <em>Putuk-</em> <em>kuralkaļ</em>, “New Voices” (Ezhutthu Prachuram, Madras, 1962) which, besides five poems by Pichamurti and Rajagopalan, contains poems composed only between 1959-1962. This volume-apart from 63 poems by 24 poets (a selection made out of about 200 pieces published on the pages of <em>Eluttu</em>)-contained also a very important introduction written by C. S. Chellappa.</p>
<p>In addition to Pichamurti’s “Wild duck”, it is probably his <em>Pettikkatai Naraṇan</em> (“Petty shopkeeper Nāraṇan”) which is Pichamurti’s best-known poem. It is a poem about the fall of modern man about a mock-hero, even an anti-hero-and the disintegration of traditional values.</p>

<p>C. S. Chellappa’s anthology contains Pichamurti’s poem <em>Pūkkāri</em> (“The flower-girl”) which shows a mature poet who has got rid of foreign influences. Below are given a few verses from parts 2 and 4 of this beautiful poem:</p>
<p>1 Transl. S. Gopalie.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the darkness of rain<br>

Not even a fly<br>

Jumped.<br>
Laughing lightning<br>
Set clouds afire.<br>
Beautiful women,<br>
Frightened and trembling,<br>
Assembled near the fire<br>
Embracing its warmth.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beginning of part 4 is a terrible vision of the modern, warridden world:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The trident arose<br>
And the universe shook.<br>
And all the world<br>
Turned<br>
Into a<br>
Tent.<br>
Everywhere in the cities<br>
Poisonous smoke.<br>
And all over the skies<br>
Steel wings of weapons<br>
Everywhere in the streets<br>
Mountains of corpses.<br>
<br>
(Transl. K. Zvelebil)<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The young authors whose poems were published in Chellappa’s anthology wanted to dissociate themselves from the stock phrases and the stock content, as well as from the “formulas” prescribing traditional forms. They refused the explicativeness and verbosity of the old, especially medieval poetry (and in this respect, their “modernity” is a return to the unsurpassed and perfect terseness and brevity of the early classical poetry). Chellappa sees them as bearers of a revolt (<em>purațci</em>) of a new, different generation. If there is indeed a break with the past, if there is a clash between “tradition” and “modernity” in contemporary Tamil culture, it takes place in the writings of these “new poets”. The first of the “revolting” poems was probably Sundara Ramaswamy’s <em>The nails</em> of <em>your hand</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Cut and throw off your nails-they gather dirt.<br>
Cut and throw off your nails-they gather dirt.<br>
The whole world outside is a heap of dirt.<br>
Why then should nail-corners be so fit for dirt ?<br>
“I may scratch, say I may,<br>
I may scratch-my enemy?”<br>
You may scratch, you may tear apart<br>
In a soothing embrace<br>
The left arm<br>
Of the lovely-eyed<br>
Will drip<br>
Blood<br>
<br>
Cut and throw off the nails of your right hand<br>
Or else<br>
Forget the joys of married life<br>
Blood<br>
oozes out<br>
from the tender thighs<br>
of that darling child<br>
whom you lift and carry<br>
on your hip<br>
Cut and throw off the nails of your left hand<br>
Or else<br>
Don’t ever more carry that child<br>
Cut and throw off your nails-they gather dirt.<br>
<br>
Cut and throw off your nails-they gather dirt.<br>
<br>
“I may dig out, say I may,<br>
I may dig out the wax from my ears?”<br>
You may dig out the dirt<br>
You may dig out the dirt<br>
There is a place for each and every filth<br>
The place may change<br>
And the filth move to the guts<br>
And go and mix with blood<br>
With your blood<br>
Cut and throw off your nails-they gather dirt.<br>
<br>
Cut and throw off your nails-they gather dirt.<br>
<br>
(Transl. K. Zvelebil)<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Chellappa (<em>New Voices</em>, Introd. p.&nbsp;10), the poem caused a furore among the readers. Most of them were shocked and disgusted.</p>
<p>Another important poem is C. Mani’s (Maņi) <em>Narakam</em> (“Hell”), published first in <em>Eḻuttu</em> 43. It is a true milestone in modern Tamil poetry. The minor theme of the unfulfilled relationship between man and woman-is set within the major theme of corruption in the city (<em>nakaram</em>). Mani’s imagery is extremely effective; his technique is influenced by T. S. Eliot. Hyperbolic abbreviation and powerful phantasy can do without much rhetoric; raw naturalism and surrealism blend in Mani’s poetry. As Chellappa says, when reading the poem one gets the feeling of witnessing a movie, “a panavision movie with stereophonic sound track”.¹ The poem has 334 lines.</p>
<p>“Like a dog poisoned by hunger / one roams about through endless streets” of the hellish city. The city of Madras. Mani describes the Marina; there are the women, whose “handfuls of tresses become stars in the southern wind, and the light of the eyes are all rainbows in the skies, and all their open lips become split hearts”. There, “in the sand wounded by feet and in the minds wounded by eyes / there are many scars …</p>

<p>T. K. Duraiswami (Turaisvāmi) is what Chellappa calles an intellectual poet. Here is one of his prose-poems, entitled ‘There is nobody who would not know’.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“There is no one who would not know the house lizard which, clinging to the wall, like a dead crocodile, clad in dull brownish colour, will suddenly jump from its lurking-place without a sound at its prey.<br>
There is no one who would not know the spider which has made its web from its spittle and, spreading its eight legs, watches motionless in the middle of the cobweb for the unfortunate butterflies and beetles which get entangled in the trap.<br>
There is nobody who would not know that there are flies which swarm and buzz like those prophets of equality, not discriminating between cleanness and filth, like those demons betraying knowledge, with small wings, warm-like bodies, purulent red heads, all covered with eyes.<br>
We also know this heap of big black ants, who organize themselves in multitudes, bearing that preposterous dark red colour, and, like some hideous spreading pools, brush aside and choke those who stand in their way, hastening next minute to death”.<br>

<p>Probably the most talented and, at the same time, the most conscious craftsman of all the “new poets” is T. S. Venugopalan. However, according to some, S. Vaitheeswaran is <em>the</em> best of all the lot.</p>

<p>T. S. Venugopalan is considered by some the most original and the most gifted of all ‘new poets’, the one who “has everything in him to become not only a great modern poet but a people’s poet as well”. When reading his poems, one can feel how very carefully he writes–the detachment and impersonality of some of his poems remind the reader of the great achievements of classical Tamil poetry of the <em>‘Cankam’</em> age. Here is how he sees the Moon, a constant companion of poets in India.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>While Vaitheeswaran is more emotional, more lyrical, more personal, more traditional, T. S. Venugopalan is more intellectual, more reflexive, impersonal, cooler; while Vaitheeswaran is more colourful, economical and yet rich in words, and more individual and self-centred, Venugopalan is more disciplined, sharper, less individual and more open towards society and contemporary problems. However, it is very difficult really to say–and probably it is quite unnecessary and even naive to try to-who is the better of the two. What is important is the fact that, unlike fifteen or even ten years ago, contemporary Tamil writing has at least two poets who are first-rate and full of growth and promise.</p>
<p>Doing away with traditional poetic forms, and trying their hand at vers libre, “prose-poetry” (<em>vacanak kavitai</em>) and other formal experiments was and still is part of the credo of the “new poets”; cf.&nbsp;<em>Eḻuttu</em> 61 where a “new poet” says</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A poem tied by prosody<br>
is like the Käviri tied by dams”.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it seems 1 that even the most “rebellious” formal experiments of the “new poets” may somehow and to some extent be reconciled with the literary <em>marapu</em> or tradition: thus, e.g., the so-called <em>centoṭai</em>, i.e.&nbsp;verses without <em>etukai</em> “rhyme (initial)” and <em>mōnai</em> “alliteration”, may be considered a kind of vers <em>libre</em>; or, rather, the free-verse experiments are nothing but a kind of traditional <em>centoṭai.</em> On the other hand, the basic properties of classical and traditional poetry and prosody are used frequently even by the most “rebellious” “new poets” simply because the features are inherently connected with the very structure and nature of Tamil phonology and syllabification, just like the notion of acai “fundamental metric unit” is inherently connected with the very rhythm of Tamil speech. Thus, e.g., if we consider a poem like D. Sivaramu’s <em>Minnal</em> (Lightning) we see a rather firm rhythmic structure in terms of the basic, “traditional” prosodic units, <em>acai</em> and <em>cir</em> “feet” (the poem being limited to the use of the socalled <em>iyaṟcīr</em> “natural feet” of two <em>acai</em> each). We also unmistakenly hear the initial alliteration (<em>mōnai</em>) of (ka-), placed most regularly at the beginning of each first feet of the four distichs.</p>
<p><em>kakanap paravai</em> <em>nīṭṭum alaku</em> katirōn <em>nilattil</em> <em>eriyum pārvai</em> <em>katalul valiyum</em> <em>amirtat tārai</em> <em>kaṭavuḷ unrum</em> cenkōl Even very daring instances like ki <em>уй</em> vi <em>lē</em> orē <em>kūṭṭam</em> <em>(Eluttu</em> 91) in the que ue one crowd 1 Cf. a very interesting essay on classical and modern prosody by Selvam (Celvam) in <em>Națai,</em> 3, April 1969.</p>
<p>may be reconciled with tradition: according to Mr.&nbsp;Selvam, the author of the cited essay on prosody (see ftn. 1, 331), such formal device was well-known as a kind of cittirakkavi “picture-poem” (cf. <em>taṇṭiyalaṅkāram</em> 68).</p>
<p>We are prepared to agree with this opinion to the extent that the “new poetry” is, indeed, reconcilable with Tamil tradition ¹ as far as the basic, “low-level” structural elements-i.e.&nbsp;the <em>acai</em> and the cir (foot), partly also the line (<em>ați</em>)-are concerned. The traditional stanzaic structures of higher levels (pā, <em>inam</em>) are, however, not adhered to by the “new poets”. Indeed, there is one very fundamental ‘high-level’ feature which means a definitive break with tradition as far as the “new poetry” is concerned. Since the early bardic poetry of the classical age up to the poems by Bharati, Tamil poetry has been <em>sung</em> or at least scanned in a sing-song manner. In some epochs and with some kinds of poetic composition, music and literature, singing and poetry became so intimately connected that the one does have hardly any existing without the other (as is the case, e.g., with the <em>patikams</em> of the classical <em>bhakti</em> poets, or with Aruṇakiri’s songs). The “new poetry”, however, is meant to be <em>read</em> and/or recited, but not sung.</p>
<p>Another novelty of this modern and avantgarde poetry lies in the new, surprisingly effective and forcible use of the traditional material; in the new, and hence different, and most powerful, utilization and application of the basic prosodic and formal properties of Tamil poetry, not in denying and destroying them.</p>
<p>Finally, the “new poets” strive seriously after an organic and intimate relation between form and meaning, after the unity of meaning (<em>poru!</em>) and form (uru, <em>uruvu</em>, <em>uruvam</em>). The “new poets” are in their absolute majority no empty formalists.² <em>L’art pour</em> l’artism is not their credo, though some of the very contemporary poets, like V. Mali, go rather far in their formal experiments. To close this chapter, I shall quote a few poems by four very recent young poets, Hari Sreenivasan, Tuṟai Seenisami, V. Mali and Shanmugam Subbiah. The choice is quite casual. The transla1 We should not forget, though, that the striving after reconciliation with tradition (<em>marapu</em>) is a very typical pan-Indian tendency, and has been so for ages.</p>
<p>3 Tamil literature has known empty, unproductive and repetitive formalism for centuries. But perhaps none of the “new poets” is one of the sterile formalists.</p>
<p>tions are mine. Let us say that these four stand for a number of other equally or probably even more important names, most of which indicate that modern Tamil literature has been finally lashed out of its lethargy, apathy and sterility.</p>

<p>1 A fine pun in the original: <em>tirainat cattivankaļ</em> virumpum | <em>tiraippatik</em> <em>kaṭavuḷ tān</em>.</p>
<p>It is a decade now since the “new poets” began their conscious attempts to evolve a new Tamil idiom, to write, uninhibitedly, about unconventional or even prohibitive themes, to get rid of fashionable foreign influences and to create a truly modern Tamil poetry. They have not made any impact on the general public. They are almost unnoticed by the common reader; they are almost hated by the orthodox traditionalists; they are entirely ignored by most professors of Tamil and Tamil literature. And yet, as S. Gopalie rightly says, “compared to the growth in other branches in Tamil literature, modern Tamil poetry has taken giant strides in recent years and has come to stay.” 1 S. Gopalie, “New bearings in Tamil poetry”, The <em>Overseas Hindustan</em> <em>Times</em>, July 26, 1969.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION 337 CONCLUSION Many unorthodox views were expressed on the preceding pages, and I am almost certain that they will meet with disapproval in some quarters. However, I strongly believe in the interpenetration of literary history and literary criticism. As Wellek and Warren rightly say, “There are simply no data in literary history which are completely neutral ‘facts’. Value judgements are implied in the very choice of materials: in the simple preliminary distinction between books and literature, in the mere allocation of space to this or that author”.1 Let me in conclusion sum up some of the views expressed in this book, in order to facilitate the orientation of those who wish to contest them.</p>
<p>I have expressed the opinion that the Tolkāppiyam, as we have it today, is not an integral and untampered with text, a work of one single author, but rather the work of an entire scholastic group, with a number of additions and interpolations, the final redaction of which is comparatively late (middle of the 1st Millennium A.D.); and that, possibly, the whole third book (<em>Poruļatikāram</em>) is later than the first two portions.</p>
<p>I disagree with the conception that early classical (Cańkam) poetry was “democratic in spirit”. I believe that this poetry—the best which has ever been composed in the Tamil language-is basically aristocratic and early feudal in outlook and bardic and clannish in origin. Judging it purely aesthetically I believe that it is fully commensurable in quality with the very peaks of world lyrical poetry, specifically of the “objective” and “professional” type. I do not consider any of the didactic texts to be truly great literature not even the Tirukkuṟaḷ. I believe that the “didactic heresy” was detrimental to both old Tamil poetry and the Tamil fiction of the 19th-20th Centuries.</p>
<p>Contrary to the opinion of traditional Tamil panditdom, I think that Iḷaṅkōvaṭikaḷ’s “Lay of the Anklet” and not the Rāmāyaṇa of the <em>kavicakravarti</em> Kampaṉ is the greatest single poem in Tamil literature.</p>
<p>I cannot fully agree with the analysis of bhakti poetry as the 1 René Wellek-Austin Warren, <em>Theory</em> of <em>Literature</em>, 3rd ed., 1963, p.&nbsp;40. literary expression of social protest. I also consider some of the <em>cittar</em> poets, particularly Tirumūlar and Paṭṭiṉattar, as great creative poets.</p>
<p>I do not regard S. Bharathi as a great “world-poet” on <em>a</em> par with some other Indian authors such as Vālmīki, Kālidāsa, Iḷaṅkō, Kampaṉ, or even Tagore and Vallathol.</p>
<p>I think that modern Tamil prose is still rather stagnate and sterile, though there are a few exceptional authors and a great promise of future inventive and creative developments. For the benefit of those who want to read good modern <em>prosateurs</em> in Tamil I shall risk to give a list of names who I believe are truly representative of good, solid, serious, even exceptional modern Tamil writing: Mauni (the “Tirumülar of short story writing” as Putumaippittaṉ called him), N. Pichamurti, K. Alagiriswamy, R. Shanmugasundaram, <em>T. Janakiraman,</em> S. Ramaswamy, L. S. <em>Ramamirtham</em>, N. Padmanabhan.</p>
<p>I consider the <em>putukkavitai</em> movement the greatest achievement of modern Tamil poetry so far. The names which I would like to specifically mention in this connection are those of N. Pichamurti, C. Mani, S. Ramaswamy, D. Sivaramu, Vallikkannan, Hari Sreenivasan, Shanmugam Subbiah, and, as truly outstanding, S. Vaitheeswaran and T. S. Venugopalan.</p>
<p>I think that the critical approaches developed in <em>Eḻuttu</em> and <em>Ilakkiya vaṭṭam</em> by C. S. Chellappa and K. N. Subrahmanyam are basically sound and correct, though they tend to be, sometimes, too iconoclastic, too sophisticated, and too exclusive and clannish. Finally, I think that the specific glory of Tamil literature, past and present, is in the “short form”-in lyrical poetry, short story, essay; while the novel, the drama, and great epos do not belongowing to a complicated network of causes-to the great achievements of Tamil.</p>
<p>Above all I believe that the outstanding works of Tamil literature of the past, and the very interesting writings of the present times, should be translated, published and spread wide; they intrinsically belong to the literary heritage of the world and man’s culture will be enriched by their general knowledge.</p>
