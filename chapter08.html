<p>According to an ancient and persistent tradition, the <em>Kalittokai</em> and the <em>paripāṭal</em> belong to the original corpus of the <em>tokai</em> (anthology) texts, and the <em>Tirumurukāṟṟuppaṭai</em> is quoted as the first of the lays (<em>pāṭṭu</em>). However great our respect for the tradition may be, we have to admit, after an unprejudiced and critical examination of these three texts, that they almost certainly do not belong to the earliest strata of the erotic and heroic poetry. The reasons for a later dating of these poems are both formal, and of a different and younger thought-content and ideology.</p>
<p><em>Kalittokai,</em> lit. “the anthology in the <em>kali</em> metre” is a collection of lovely songs which try to capture all phases, types and details of love-experience; the anthology is an <em>akam</em> collection par <em>excellence</em>, and, in fact, it seems to have been composed after the first arrangement, systematization and classification of love-themes and lovesituations had been worked out by some of the early scholiasts: the peruntiṇai and kaikkiḷai situations (mismatched and one-sided love-affairs) were added to complete the cycle of total love-experience of man. It also seems that some folkmotifs and “vulgar” (&lt;vul<em>gus</em>) trends forced their way into the classical erotic poetry, with rudimentary humorous and dramatic situations, with elements of farce and buffoonery: the poems, composed in this new tone, deal with affairs which are “common”, “abnormal”, “undignified”, fit only for “servants and workmen”; affairs which are fit for the ignorant, the uncultured. These poems were not accepted as <em>akam</em> proper by later theoreticians and compilers of the early anthologies, but were classed under the kaikkiḷai and <em>peruntiṇai</em> situations, the one-sided affair and the mismatched relationship.</p>
<p>The anthology has 150 poems in the kali metre. The first poem is an invocation to Siva, and the rest are love-poems divided into the five traditional divisions: 35 stanzas about <em>pālai</em>, 29 about <em>kuṟiňci,</em> 33 songs on <em>neytal.</em> 1 The compiler of the anthology was a certain 1 The <em>peruntiṇai</em> and kaikkiḷai situations are handled as additional to the five <em>tiṇais</em>.</p>
<p>Nallantuvaṇār, supposed to be the author of the <em>neytal</em> portion, and there exists a detailed and excellent commentary by Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar (14th Cent.).</p>
<p>The background of the poem is the same as in early classical poetry; but the tone is different. In a way, it is precisely the <em>Kalittokai</em> anthology which marks a definite break from the early classical tradition and conventions.</p>
<p>There are two fundamental problems to be dealt with in connection with this anthology: first, the problem of the dating; second, the question of authorship.</p>
<p>A very strong evidence points to the fact that the poems of <em>Kalittokai</em> should be dated considerably later than the other anthologies, roughly between the 5th-7th Cent. A.D.</p>
<p>First, the form, the metre, the structure of the poems, when compared with the <em>akaval</em> and <em>vaňci</em> stanzas of early classical poetry, display further development; the <em>kali</em> metre itself appears to have been a later development; the <em>kali</em> stanza seems to be a combination and a development of the <em>āciriyam</em> and the <em>veņpā.</em> It can hardly be denied that the <em>kali</em>-metre and the <em>kali</em>-stanza is later, historically younger than the <em>akaval</em> (and <em>vaňci</em>). There are new structural elements in the <em>kali</em> stanzas: <em>dialogues</em> which sometimes look like “a one-act play in miniature” (C. and H. Jesudasan, op. cit. 67). Thus we have dialogues between the heroine and her girl-friend (60), the heroine and the hero (64), the girl-friend and the hero (61) etc. The narrative pieces which may be considered as miniature tales are also new. Thus there is, apart from the still predominantly lyrical character of the poetry, a new, rudimentary but vigorous, dramatic and epic component in the <em>Kalittokai</em>. New <em>dramatis</em> personae appear, too, folk-types like <em>kāmakkiļatti</em> (67, 72, 73) “match-maker”<em>, kūni</em> (94) “the hunchback woman” and <em>kuralan (ib</em>.) “the dwarf”.</p>
<p>As already stressed, the tone is new and different: realistic attitude, coarseness, spicy and racy dialogues, absence of delicacy, broad jokes, crude humour, echoes of folk-songs. As a typical instance one may quote the magnificent, rude, bawdy, and yet strangely moving and poetic dialogue between the hunchback woman and the dwarf (<em>Kalit</em>. 94, in the flawless translation of A. K. Ramanujan):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>O hunchback woman,<br>
gentle<br>
and crooked as a reflection<br>
in the water,<br>
what great good deeds<br>
did you do that I should want you so?<br>
(O mother! she swore to herself) Some<br>
auspicious moment made you dwarf,<br>
so tiny you’re almost invisible,<br>
O whelp born to a man-faced bird,<br>
how dare you stop us to say<br>
you want us? Would such midgets<br>
ever get to touch such as us?<br>
O lovely one,<br>
curvaceous,<br>
convex<br>
as the blade of a plough,<br>
you strike me with love<br>
I cannot bear.<br>
I can live<br>
only by your grace.<br>
(Look at the way this creature walks!)<br>
O dwarf, standing piece of timber,<br>
you’ve yet to learn the right approach<br>
to girls. Humans do not copulate<br>
at noon: but you come now to hold<br>
our hand and ask us to your place.<br>
Good woman,<br>
your waist is higher<br>
than your head, your face a skinned heron<br>
with a dagger for a beak,<br>
listen to me.<br>
If I take you in the front, your hunch<br>
juts in my chest; if from the back<br>
it’ll tickle me in odd places.<br>
So, I’ll not<br>
even try it. Yet come close and let’s touch<br>
side by side.<br>
<em>Chi,</em> you’re wicked. Get lost! You half-man!<br>
As creepers hang on only to the crook of the tree<br>
there are men who’d love to hold this hunch<br>
of a body close, though nothing fits. Yet, you lecher,<br>
you ask for us sideways. What’s so wrong<br>
with us, you ball, you bush of a man,<br>
A gentle hunchback type is better far than a string<br>
of black beans.<br>
(Look at the walk of this creature!) You stand<br>
like a creepy turtle stood up by somebody,<br>
hands flailing in your armpits.<br>
We’ve told you we’re not for you. Yet you hang around.<br>
(Look, he walks now like the Love-God)!<br>
The root of this love is Kāma,<br>
the love-god with arrows, brother to Shāma.<br>
Look, this is how the love-god walks!<br>
(Look,<br>
look at this love-god!)<br>
Come, let’s find joy,<br>
you in me, me in you; come, let’s ask and talk<br>
agree which parts I touch.<br>
and<br>
I swear<br>
by the feet of my king, I’ll mock you no more.<br>
Right, O gentle-breasted one. I too will give up<br>
mockery.<br>
But I don’t want this crowd in the temple<br>
laughing at us, screaming when we do it,<br>
‘Look, look! Look at that dwarf and hunchback,<br>
leaping like demon on demon!’<br>
O shape<br>
of unbeaten gold, let’s get away from the temple<br>
to the wild jasmine bush. Come, let’s go.<br>
You’re now a gob of wax on a parchment<br>
made out in a court full of wise men,<br>
and stamped<br>
to a seal; you’re now flat, incomplete. Come,<br>
let’s touch close and hug hard<br>
and finish the unfinished.<br>
Let’s go.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the traditional <em>aintiṇai</em> (i.e.&nbsp;“love proper”) situations continue in <em>Kalittokai</em> and even receive new possibilities and new additions.</p>
<p>The language of <em>Kalittokai</em> manifests some features which are undoubtedly to be considered as innovations, both lexical and structural (e.g.&nbsp;the suffix <em>-kāl</em> in <em>allākkāl</em> 124, <em>-ēl</em> in <em>kāṭṭāyēl</em> 144, the form <em>āṇāl</em> in 139, further cf.&nbsp;stanzas 84, 87, 90, 93, 130). A relatively high number of Sanskrit loanwords (like <em>kāman, kāraṇam</em>, <em>kuṇanka!</em> with the pl. suff. <em>-kaļ, picācar, mēkalai</em>, <em>vacciram</em>) attests, too, a later origin.</p>
<p>Earlier poems are often quoted, e.g.&nbsp;<em>Kur</em>. 18.5 <em>uyirtavac</em> ciṟitu <em>kāmamō</em> peritē “the endurance of my soul is small, but passion of</p>
<p>love is indeed great” reappears in <em>Kali</em>. 137.2: <em>peritē kāmamen nuyir-</em> <em>tavac ciṟitē</em>.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire collection, no name of any king is mentioned but of the <em>Panțiya</em> in Maturai (55). No poets, chieftains, battles etc. mentioned in the other <em>tokai</em> anthologies are alluded to in the <em>Kalittokai.</em> On the other hand, <em>Kuṛiñcikkali</em> 24 mentions “the merciful men of Benares”, and in <em>Marutakkali</em> 29 there is an allusion to Kāma (also elsewhere; these are the first allusions to this relatively late Aryan import into Tamil literature). Actually, the whole collection is permeated with allusions to Sanskritic Purāņic legends: the burning of the three cities by Śiva (1), the plans of Duryodhana to kill the Pāṇḍavas (25), the battle between Murukaṉ and Sūrapadma (27), Rāvaṇa lifting Mount Kailāsa (38), Bhima beating Duryodhana on the thigh (52), Kṛṣṇa killing Kamsa’s wrestlers (52, 134), Śiva thwarting Yama (101), Urvaśi and Tilottamā (109), the story of Yayāti (139), Śiva bearing Gaṅgā in his locks (150), Kṛṣṇa killing the horse-demon (103), Kṛṣṇa hiding the sun with his <em>cakra</em> (104), etc.</p>
<p>All these facts point rather conclusively to the post-early classical origin of <em>Kalittokai</em>.</p>
<p>1 In many ways, the collection seems to be work of one author; the subject-matter, the style, the metre, the language. all indicates an individual authorship of the whole collection (granted even the over-all uniformity and homogeneity of the bardic poetry). On the other hand, a rather late <em>veṇpā</em> quatrain ¹ exists which ascribes the five divisions of the anthology to five “Sangam” poets: <em>pālai</em> to Perunkaṭunkōn, <em>kuṟiňci</em> to the great Kapilar, <em>marutam</em> to Marutan Iļanākaṇār, <em>mullai</em> to Cōḻaṉ Nalluruttiran and <em>neytal</em> to Nallantuvaṇār the Compiler. The <em>veṇpā</em> itself is not found in any manuscript of the text, and is unknown to the commentator; its veracity may be doubted. Allmost all serious scholars (the first editor of the work, S. V. Damodaram Pillai, 1887, K. N. Sivaraja Pillai, Rajamanikkam, H. W. Schomerus) are inclined to regard <em>Kalittokai</em> as the work of one poet, who probably belonged to the <em>Pāṇṭiyaland.</em> The problem is far from definitely solved. But the work itself is great and deserves careful study, monographic treatment, and a congenial translation in toto.</p>
<p><em>paripāṭal</em> is traditionally enumerated as the fifth of the collec1 Cf. Vaiyapuri Piḷḷai, <em>Ilakkiya</em> tipam (1952) 81.</p>
<p>tions <em>(tokai</em>); it is an odd, hybrid work, partly traditional lovepoetry and partly a work of <em>bhakti</em>. It is a collection of poems in the <em>paripaṭal</em> metre,1 which seems to be further development of the old classical metres. Of the seventy poems supposed to have been originally included in this work, only twenty four are extant in full (a few more are in fragments, and some (22, 24) may be found in a commentary on the <em>Tōlkappiyam,</em> and in the medieval anthology <em>Purattiraṭṭu)</em>. Of the extant poems, seven are dedicated to Tirumāl, eight to Cevvēļ (Murukan), and nine to the river Vaikai. In the Vaikai-portion, the love-theme is worked out along the traditional lines against the background of bathing festivities. The stanzas are ascribed to 13 poets, one of whom figures among the poets of other anthologies.</p>
<p>The most noticeable feature of this collection are the colophons to each stanza which, beside the name of the author, give also the names of the composer who set it to music and of the tune to which it was set. The basic tunes (<em>paņ</em>, <em>icai</em>) are <em>pālai</em>, <em>yāl, tiram</em> and <em>kāntāram</em>; the names of the composers are Kaṇṇakaṇār, Kaṇṇanākaṇār, Kēcavaṇār Nallaccutaṇār, Naṇṇākaṇār, Nākaṇār, Pittāmattar, Pēṭṭaṇākaṇār, Maruttuvan Nallaccutaṇār. There is a detailed commentary available composed by Parimēlaḻakar. The work was published first in 1918 by U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar. It seems that the poems were indeed composed as songs, intended to be sung. The work is relatively late. It seems to be separated at least by three centuries from the earlier collections. First of all, there are many Aryan loanwords, and their number and nature betray a late origin of the text, e.g.&nbsp;<em>kavitai</em> (6), <em>mitunam</em> (11), <em>cintikka</em> (20), pōkam (5), <em>kamalam</em> (2) etc. There are also some characteristic grammatical innovations like the present-tense suffix -kiny-, and forms which are undoubtedly rather late in the history of the language, e.g.&nbsp;<em>nāṇ</em> (20.82) “I”, or <em>āmām</em> “emphatic affirmation”.</p>
<p>1 <em>paripāṭal</em> is mentioned as a metre in <em>Tolk. Ceyyul</em>. 242. The number of lines is unlimited; it is on the whole a rather loose structure with verses ranging from one foot to four feet, exceptionally to five feet, and it provides for much variety. For the hybrid nature of the work, cf.&nbsp;e.g.&nbsp;the definition of its content in <em>Yapparunkala virutti</em>: <em>teyvamum kāmamum poruļāka varum</em> “as the subject-matter, both devotion and love occur”. Out of the 70 original stanzas, 8 should have been dedicated to <em>Tirumal</em>, 31 to <em>Murukaṉ</em>, I to <em>Kāṭukilā!</em> (<em>Korravai</em>?), 26 to the river Vaikai, 4 to <em>Maturai.</em> All commentators, beginning with Iḷampūraṇar, interpret the term <em>paripățal</em> as <em>parinta</em> <em>pāṭṭu</em> “running, speeding, rapid song”.</p>
<p>Second, there are references in the text to temples and shrines which must have been built in the post-classical period (Tiruvēnkațam, Tiruvaṇantapuram etc.), and mural paintings on the walls of Tirupparankunṛam temple are mentioned depicting stars and planets. Many allusions to a number of <em>Puranic</em> stories betray, too, the relatively late origin of the poem: thus we hear of the churning of the ocean of milk (2.71-72, 3-33-4), of Prahlāda (4.12-21), of the birth of Murukaṉ (5.27-49), of the destruction of the three cities (5.25) etc. There is no great devotional fervour in the poems, and the lyrical quality of the text is not exactly outstanding. One can regard these poems as a form of transition-not very successful-between the classical, traditional love poetry, and the emerging, devotional, <em>bhakti</em> literature.</p>
<p>More interesting, and better poetry, is the first intensely devotional poem in Tamil literature, the <em>Tirumurukāṟṟuppaṭai</em>. As the name suggests, it is a “guide” poem, not to any liberal patron of arts, however, but to different manifestations of god Murukaṉ. The devotee, the <em>bhakta,</em> is directed by the poet to various shrines of the god. The “Guide to Lord Muruku” seems to have been considered by the redactor of the <em>Pattuppāṭṭu</em> collection as the invocatory lay to the “Ten Songs” (in analogy with the invocatory stanzas prefixed to the Anthology collections).¹ The poem is held in very high esteem not only by Murukaṉ worshippers for whom it is the most ancient and fundamental text, but by all Saivites. It is an excellent poem in 312 <em>akaval</em> verses, and it is ascribed to Nakkīrar (whom the tradition makes identical with the author of the early lyrical pieces, but who is very probably much younger than the “Sangam” Nakkīrar; he may be identical with the author of the commentary to <em>Iṟaiyaṉār Akapporu!).</em></p>
<p>The poem is carefully planned out, according to a definite scheme which is based upon a very fundamental conception in South Indian Hinduism: the intimate connection between a particular place of worship and the god’s “local” manifestation. The poem has six parts of unequal length: the first describes the beauty of Murukaṉ, the killing of Surapadma, the excellence of Maturai and Tirupparankunram; in the second, the six faces of Murukaṉ are described and their functions, as well as his twelve arms and their work, and the temple in Tiruccir; the third part deals with the shrine in Tiruvāvi1 K. Kailasapathy, op. cit. 35.</p>
<p>nankuți, the fourth with the temple in Tiruvēṟakam, in the fifth the poet narrates the sports of the god in the hills, the sixth describes the shrine in Palamutirccolai.</p>
<p>The effects of contrast are exploited cleverly by the poet: Murukaṉ, surrounded by lovely goddesses, is very different from the Murukaṉ in the battlefield. There the “she-devil (<em>pēymaka!)</em> dances the <em>tuṇankai</em> dance …</p>

Jesudasan, op. cit. 187) aspects in Tamil literature. In heroic poems of the early classical age, the gory aspect plays quite a prominent role; as in heroic poetry elsewhere, and in the feudal poetry of the Occident, the gory and gruesome face of killing is described with gusto and in detail: it is a part of the prowess and glory of the heroes the “assertion of superior force” (K. Kailasapathy, op. cit. 239). There are many instances of gruesome scenes in Tamil bardic poetry, with “trunks dancing”, “vultures feeding upon carrion”, “elephants pierced with arrows”, “spears soaked in blood” etc. As an instance, a few lines from <em>Patiṟṟuppattu</em> 49.10-44 may be quoted (Kailasapathy, op. cit. 240): “The blood gushing out of the chests of the warriors of red hands who opposed you, flows and spreads on the ground like the reddish muddy water that flows on to the low lying lands on a rainy day. Terrible is the destruction you bring on the battle field, where you pile up fallen corpses”. <em>Tolk</em>. has a poetic theme called <em>aṭṭaiyāṭal</em> (cf.&nbsp;Ka. <em>aṭṭe</em> “a headless trunk”, Te. <em>aṭṭa</em> “id.”, <em>DED</em> 90): “hero’s body continuing to manifest heroic deeds even after dismemberment, as the quivering of a leech (<em>aṭṭai,</em> DED 89) after being cut into two”. Slaughter of men and animals alike is described with great gusto. From the <em>gloire</em> of a slayer of elephants, an entire genre developed in the middle ages: the <em>paraņi,</em> a war poem about a hero who has destroyed 700 elephants. The greatest of the <em>paraņis</em> is <em>Kaliṅkattupparaṇi</em> by Cayankoṇṭār, the courtpoet of Kulōttuńka Cōḻa (1070-1122). In many ways, it is a great and marvellous poem, probably the most colourful poem in the entire Tamil literature, in which erotic experience and blood-thirstiness is painted in the same glowing colours. But the fantastic and the gruesome have perhaps “not been treated with more vividness elsewhere in Tamil literature” ( C. and H. Jesudasan, op. cit. 187). The poem is inhabited by blood-lusting devils, lean and famished for want of human flesh. After the battle, the devils, with mouths watering, rush in a wild stampede to the battle-field. The Brahmin devil gapes for the tasty soup of stinking corpses, but the Jain devil (which does not take life and eats only once a day) is to be given the strained soup indeed an admirable sense of humour on the part of the poet! And the Buddhist devil, going about wrapped in skins, is given the delicious brains of the dead (this, too, is humour). An extremely relevant passage of the great medieval commentator Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar on <em>TP</em> gives much insight on the theme of sacrifice to the devils (<em>pey,</em> DED 3635 “demon, goblin, fiend, devil”, To. <em>on</em> “god of the dead”, in Gondi, Kui and Kuvi “god”, which is very suggestive). A gruesome ritual was performed in honour of Korravai, the goddess of war and victory, and probably the old Dravidian mother-goddess (<em>DED</em> 1803 <em>korram</em> “victory, power, bravery”). It consisted of the following features: 1) it was performed at the end of a battle by the victors; 2) wholesale sacrifice of men, animals and weapons took place; 3) some sort of ritual cooking was done, using blood; 4) priestesses officiated at the ceremony. It seems though this needs further and careful investigation–that there are references to the ritual of human sacrifice (and probably an echo of cannibalism) in <em>Puṟam</em> 62, 356, 359, 369-71, <em>Patiṟṟup</em>. 13, 15, etc.</p></div></div></div>
<p>The whole poem seems to be aglow with red, the colour of Murukaṉ; images of blood are frequent (e.g.&nbsp;“pure white rice mixed with the blood of a fat strong ram with stout legs” is brought as an offering to the god); Murukaṉ’s body glows like the sun rising from the emerald sea—the peacock which the “red god” rides; celestial damsels, blessing the cock-banner of the youthful god, have</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“… bright, rosy, tender feet …<br>
thin garments purple like the Indragopa”;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the hills grow the <em>kāntaḷ</em> flowers red like fire; and across his handsome wide chest run red lines <em>(cempori</em>).</p>
<p>Flames, blood, red garments, red lustre-we encounter these images again and again, and probably the most frequent epithet is “shining, lustrous” and “fire-like” <em>(vāļ</em> in 8, 87, 90, ol in 28, 31, 54, tikal in 40, <em>cuṭar</em> in 43, 46, <em>min</em> in 85, <em>nakai</em> in 86, viļaku in 87, etc. etc.).</p>
<p>There are also a few magnificent natural scenes; and the technique of contrast is cleverly employed. Listen to the first 20 lines in a very inadequate translation:</p>

<p>Murukaṉ has two wives; the senior, Teyvayāṇai, is the daughter of Indra; the younger is “the beautiful daughter of the hunters, little Vaḷḷi, with creeper-like slender waist” (101-102).¹ The god’s priest is called <em>vēlan</em> (190) “he who wears the spear”; and the men in the jungle drink in the god’s honour liquor prepared from honey matured in bamboo (<em>nīṭamai viļainta tēkkaṭ ṭēral,</em> 195). But, in his temples, there are also the <em>dvijas</em>, the twice-born (<em>iruppirappāļar,</em> 182), wearing the sacred thread of three bands. Elsewhere, the Vedas are mentioned (<em>mantiram</em>, 95), and the sages (<em>munivar</em>, 137); and the whole poem shows in fact the fusion of the Brahmanic god Skanda with the pre-Aryan, South Indian Murukaṉ. The poem contains much old, traditional material (like the relationship of Murukaṉ to Korravai, the old mother-goddess of the Tamils). It is typically a poem of transition, marking the end of an epoch, the 1 According to later speculations, <em>kaṟpu</em> “chastity” is of two types: the stern (<em>maram</em>) and the gentle (<em>aram</em>). Draupadi and Kaṇṇaki represent the former type, while Sītā and Teyvayāṇai represent “gentle chastity”. 9</p>
<p>end of pre-Aryan Tamilnad, the end of the classical age; and the beginning of an entirely different age which is heralded by the rise of devotional literature. It is perhaps significant that the first truly religious, devotional poem in Tamil is dedicated to Murukaṉ, the Tamil deity <em>par excellence</em>.</p>
<p>Apart from what was said about its subject matter, there are also other indications that the poem may hardly be older than about 550-600 A.D.; there are some very serious authors who place it around A.D. 800.¹ There are some rather late forms and innovations in the language (<em>perīiyar</em> 168, <em>nalkumati</em> 295 etc.); many of the Aryan loanwords (which are abundant) are rather late borrowings <em>(tilakam</em>, <em>nakaram, caṇpakam, ankucam</em> etc.); earlier texts are cited (e.g.&nbsp;<em>Nar.</em> 62: <em>Tirumuruk</em>. 24). There is also the fact that, according to U. V. Swaminatha Aiyar, most of the <em>Pattuppāṭṭu</em> manuscripts used by him for his edition do not contain the text of this poem. The poem is very important for the development of South Indian <em>bhakti</em> in that it contains, in lines 60-66, the summary of its fundamental principles: salvation as the goal of existence; salvation means to take one’s station at the feet of the Lord; to love the Lord; to attain this means to give up egoism, sense of separation (63, 64); the poem says literally: “to reach the feet of Cēy with elevated heart” <em>(cēeycēvați pataruň cemma lullamotu</em> (61-62). This is pure bhakti.</p>
<p>No wonder that the poem found its way into the 11th <em>Tirumuṟai,</em> the corpus of Saivite Canonical writings.</p>
<p>1 S. Vaiyapuri Pillai<em>, HTLL</em> p.&nbsp;58. On p.&nbsp;113, he dates it “about A.D. 700”.</p>
